# Introduction

Evolutionary studies have greatly enhanced our comprehension of fundamental natural and social phenomena, spanning from biological evolution to cultural and societal changes. Originating from humanity's enduring quest to understand life's origins and development, the notion of evolution can be traced to the intellectual explorations of early civilizations in antiquity. Early inklings of transformation of species over time appear in the works of philosophers Anaximander and Empedocles, dating back to the 6th century BC [@delisle2019charles;@dercole2008analysis;@glass1968forerunners;@himmelfarb1968darwin]. Nonetheless, it wasn't until the 19th century that evolutionary thought began to crystallize into a formal scientific discipline.

Charles Darwin's 1859 seminal work "On the Origin of Species" [-@darwin1964origin] laid the foundation for modern evolutionary theory. Darwin proposed the mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind evolution, whereby organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to subsequent generations. This revolutionary idea sparked intense debate and controversy during and after Darwin's own life, challenging traditional religious and philosophical beliefs about the origins of life. Notwithstanding, evolutionary thought did not solely stem from the contributions of a single man. While Darwin's work catalyzed the formalization of evolutionary theory, its development was the result of a rich tradition and the convergence of multiple disciplines shaped by a diverse array of thinkers spanning various fields [@prestes2023understanding;@brake2016revolution;@deichmann2010darwinism].

Early scholars in the tradition of evolutionary thought commonly explored patterns of change and adaptation across biological, cultural, and social contexts. Anthropologists like Herbert Spencer and Lewis Henry Morgan explored the evolution of human societies and cultures, laying the groundwork for the field of cultural evolution. Likewise, sociologists such as Ã‰mile Durkheim and Max Weber investigated social change and the evolution of institutions within societies. Moreover, the interdisciplinary character of evolutionary thought became apparent as it began incorporating insights from more diverse fields, including psychology, archaeology, and linguistics. Each discipline provided distinctive perspectives on the mechanisms and processes of change, thereby enhancing our comprehension of evolution in its widest scope.

Evolutionary economics, akin to other evolutionary branches in the social sciences, aligned with tradition by applying principles of variation, selection, and adaptation to economic dynamics. Pioneering economists like Thorstein Veblen and Joseph Schumpeter drew parallels between biological evolution and economic processes, emphasizing innovation, competition, and adaptation's role. The evolutionary theory of the firm, introduced in the early 1980s by Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter [-@nelson1982evolutionary], deepened this connection. They advocated for examining firm behavior and organizational change through the lens of principles such as variation, selection, and retention. Their approach underscored the importance of routines, capabilities, and organizational learning in shaping the evolution of firms. Additionally, evolutionary economics acknowledged historical contingency and path dependence's importance in shaping economic outcomes. Such a perspective underscored that current economic systems result from cumulative historical processes, with past events exerting lasting influence.

As evolutionary theory continued to progress, shedding light on a myriad of phenomena from the origins of life to the behaviors of organisms and human societies, its potential as an integrative framework and alternative to classical thought remains unrealized. This is especially evident in evolutionary economics, where despite continuous efforts to integrate evolutionary principles into economic theory, the field remains on the periphery of the economics profession, largely overshadowed by the dominance of neoclassical models in mainstream economics. An important critique concerns perceived deficiencies in formalization and integration within the field. Furthermore, evolutionary economics confronts contemporary challenges, including those stemming from technological advances, environmental sustainability concerns, and geoeconomic disparities. These challenges are amplified by increasing demands for evolutionary economic principles to inform policy responses to disruptive changes, thereby intensifying scrutiny of the field's efficacy in addressing a wide array of issues, including innovation policies, industrial strategies, and environmental regulations.

This article aims to advance the formalization and integration of evolutionary thinking in the study of firms as dynamic, living entities. By constructing a meta-framework, this research seeks to consolidate the core structural components and their interconnections into a comprehensive analytical model of the evolutionary firm. The effort is designed to address existing barriers that hinder the effective application of evolutionary thinking by scholars and practitioners. Ultimately, the goal is to deepen our understanding of firms and their behavioral dynamics.

The subsequent sections fulfill distinct objectives to achieve this aim: Section 1 establishes the foundation by delineating the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and its integration into economics, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of evolutionary studies. **Section 2: Summary of Weaknesses in the Literature identifies and discusses the main weaknesses in the existing literature pertaining to evolutionary analysis of firms, providing a critical overview of the current state of evolutionary economics research. Section 3: Description and Explanation of the Evolutionary Framework from Biology utilizes Bowler's "Evolution" book as a reference to elucidate the components and main relationships of the evolutionary framework from biology, establishing the theoretical underpinnings for subsequent analysis. Section 4: Construction of a Meta-framework for the Evolutionary Analysis of the Firm proposes a meta-framework tailored to the analysis of firms, integrating insights from evolutionary economics and related fields to provide a comprehensive approach to studying firm behavior. Section 5: Discussion of the Main Consequences of the Meta-framework explores and discusses the implications of the proposed meta-framework for evolutionary analysis of firms, elucidating its potential contributions to scholarly inquiry and practical application. Section 6: Limitations and Future Lines of Research acknowledges the limitations of the research conducted and outlines potential avenues for future research in evolutionary economics and the analysis of firm behavior. Finally, Section 7: Conclusion offers a succinct summary of the main contributions of the paper, highlighting the significance of the proposed meta-framework and suggesting directions for further exploration in the field of evolutionary economics.**
