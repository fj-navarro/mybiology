# The Rationale of the Meta-Framework

Despite the absence of a universally accepted definition within qualitative research, frameworks have emerged as instrumental tools bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and empirical observations [@partelow2023framework; @mollinga2008rational]. Framework analysis is a structured approach to thematic analysis that facilitates comparison by organizing data within a framework of themes derived both inductively and deductively. This qualitative research method combines detailed data description with abstraction, enabling a systematic analysis that examines relationships and patterns across the dataset [@goldsmith2021using]. 

In recent decades, the utility of frameworks have transcended disciplinary boundaries, attracting significant attention across a wide spectrum of scientific fields, including the natural and social sciences, technological advancements, education, and environmental studies, to name a few. Its widespread adoption is further evidenced by the routine application of established frameworks by scientific and professional organizations, as well as policymakers worldwide.

The value of frameworks also extends to the realm of academic research. They provide a structure for operationalizing and organizing scientific knowledge, fostering the development of a shared language, and promoting standardized research processes [@binder2013comparison]. Broadly, two primary categories of frameworks can be identified: those designed to capture the complex workings of a phenomenon or system, and those focused on simplifying core concepts. Beyond their specific aims, frameworks serve as a resource of reference for scholars and practitioners. They facilitate the navigation of complex interactions between diverse phenomena, ultimately enhancing the analysis and integration of emerging knowledge [@pulver2018frontiers].

From an epistemological standpoint, frameworks, regardless of their development approach (top-down or bottom-up), play a pivotal role in bridging the divide between various levels and scales of scientific knowledge. They connect broader, more general knowledge structures like paradigms or grand theories with more specific levels like models or case studies. In essence, frameworks are designed to "organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory" [@partelow2023framework]. Ultimately, frameworks streamline the scientific process by guiding researchers in study design and offering a foundation of key concepts and measurable, comparable, and evaluable fundamental knowledge.

## The Value of Meta-Frameworks

Meta-frameworks prevent researchers from constantly "reinventing the wheel" with each new investigation. Instead, meta-frameworks facilitate advancements by allowing researchers to apply them to less explored areas or integrate them with novel knowledge from other disciplines. Meta-frameworks further empower researchers by contextualizing their work within a specific field, providing a robust collection of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms with demonstrated utility in that domain [@cox2016synthesizing]. This not only facilitates knowledge synthesis and focus on key concepts and their relationships, but also stimulates scholarly discourse, fosters collaborative and interdisciplinary research endeavors, and lays the groundwork for subsequent empirical studies and effective communication of advancements and discoveries.

Despite their recent proliferation and wide-ranging applications across science, governance, and policy-making, concerns regarding meta-framework creation and use still persists. Critics argue that meta-frameworks can become "black boxes," lacking transparency in concept selection and relationship establishment. However, meta-frameworks typically emerge from a foundation of prior knowledge and experience, combined with empirical synthesis processes that integrate existing knowledge with research findings to develop more comprehensive frameworks.

As with other qualitative analysis systems, it is true that following development, meta-frameworks require operationalization, presenting challenges for both creators and users. Strategies need to be devised for case selection, synthesis activities, and integration with real-world data. These challenges underscore the critical importance of transparent and systematic methodologies for meta-framework synthesis.

## Benefits of the Meta-Framework

The construction of a meta-framework on evolution is driven by its numerous potential benefits and contributions to the field. Firstly, a meta-framework, essentially a synthesis of existing frameworks, offers a robust methodological approach to address the dispersed nature of knowledge on the concept and process of firm evolution. By integrating insights from evolutionary economics, organizational theory, and related disciplines, our meta-framework establishes a unifying structure that bridges diverse research strands related to evolutionary firm behavior. This holistic perspective, which connects micro-level organizational dynamics with macro-level environmental influences, offers substantial advantages. A meta-framework serves as a valuable tool for both scholars and practitioners, enabling them to craft more effective strategies for managing organizational change, promoting innovation, and adapting to dynamic market conditions.

Secondly, the meta-framework serves as a methodological bridge, linking theoretical concepts with empirical observations in the evolutionary analysis of firms. It offers a structured approach for organizing diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiries, providing researchers with a standardized vocabulary of core concepts and essential terms for building causal explanations. This systematic methodology promotes rigor and coherence in research, facilitating clearer interpretation of empirical findings and driving theoretical advancements in understanding firm behavior.

Thirdly, the meta-framework facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing a shared language and conceptual framework for scholars and practitioners across diverse disciplinary backgrounds. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, the meta-framework encourages the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers, fostering innovative insights and perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly important for addressing complex research questions that necessitate multifaceted analyses drawing from multiple knowledge domains.

Fourth, the step-by-step procedural approach used to construct the meta-framework ensures a high degree of transparency. This clarity enables a precise delineation of the systematic processes involved in data analysis, from descriptive exploration to explanatory inference. The transparency also extends to the researchers' interpretive efforts, providing a clear and traceable progression of analytical insights in studies focused on evolution and the behavior of the firm.

Fifth, unlike other qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, constructing a meta-framework adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby accommodation to a wider range of data types and research contexts [@goldsmith2021using; @gale2013using]. Such flexibility is crucial for this investigation, as it relies primarily on secondary data from both conceptual and empirical studies on evolution across the natural and social sciences. By synthesizing insights from diverse disciplines, the meta-framework enables a comprehensive perspective that transcends traditional boundaries, fostering a deeper understanding of evolutionary dynamics within firms.

In conclusion, developing a meta-framework aligns with the research objectives of this study, providing a comprehensive and systematic approach to analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of firms. It fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, supports the advancement of theoretical frameworks, and significantly contributes to the progress of evolutionary economics.
