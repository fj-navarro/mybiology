# The Value of an Evolutionary Meta-Framework

Despite the absence of a universally accepted definition within qualitative research, frameworks and meta-frameworks have emerged as instrumental tools bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and empirical observations [@partelow2023framework; @mollinga2008rational]. In recent decades, their utility has transcended disciplinary boundaries, attracting significant attention across a wide spectrum of scientific fields, including the natural and social sciences, technological advancements, education, and environmental studies. Its widespread adoption is further evidenced by the routine application of established frameworks by scientific and professional organizations, as well as policymakers worldwide.

The value of frameworks also extends to the realm of academic research. They provide a structure for operationalizing and organizing scientific knowledge, fostering the development of a shared language, and promoting standardized research processes [@binder2013comparison]. Broadly, two primary categories of frameworks can be identified: those designed to capture the complex workings of a phenomenon or system, and those focused on simplifying core concepts. Beyond their specific aims, frameworks serve as a resource of reference for scholars and practitioners. They facilitate the navigation of complex interactions between diverse phenomena, ultimately enhancing the analysis and integration of emerging knowledge [@pulver2018frontiers].

From an epistemological standpoint, frameworks, regardless of their development approach (top-down or bottom-up), play a pivotal role in bridging the divide between various levels and scales of scientific knowledge. They connect broader, more general knowledge structures like paradigms or grand theories with more specific levels like models or case. In essence, frameworks are designed to "organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory" [@partelow2023framework]. Ultimately, these tools streamline the scientific process by guiding researchers in study design and offering a foundation of key concepts and measurable, comparable, and evaluable fundamental knowledge.

Meta-frameworks prevent researchers from constantly "reinventing the wheel" with each new investigation. Instead, meta-frameworks facilitate advancements by allowing researchers to apply them to less explored areas or integrate them with novel knowledge from other disciplines. Meta-frameworks further empower researchers by contextualizing their work within a specific field, providing a robust collection of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms with demonstrated utility in that domain [@cox2016synthesizing]. This not only facilitates knowledge synthesis and focus on key concepts and their relationships, but also stimulates scholarly discourse, fosters collaborative and interdisciplinary research endeavors, and lays the groundwork for subsequent empirical studies and effective communication of advancements and discoveries.

Despite their recent proliferation and wide-ranging applications across science, governance, and policy-making, concerns regarding meta-framework creation and use still persists. Critics argue that meta-frameworks can become "black boxes," lacking transparency in concept selection and relationship establishment. However, meta-frameworks typically emerge from a foundation of prior knowledge and experience, combined with empirical synthesis processes that integrate existing knowledge with research findings to develop more comprehensive frameworks. Last but not least, following development, meta-frameworks require operationalization, presenting challenges for both creators and users. Strategies need to be devised for case selection, synthesis activities, and integration with real-world data. These challenges underscore the critical importance of transparent and systematic methodologies for meta-framework synthesis.

## The Rationale of Our  Meta-Framework

The rationale for constructing our meta-framework stems from the following considerations. Firstly, a meta-framework, essentially a synthesis of existing frameworks, offers a robust methodological approach to address the dispersed nature of knowledge on firm evolution. By integrating insights from evolutionary economics, organizational theory, and related disciplines, our meta-framework establishes a unifying structure that bridges diverse research strands related to firm behavior. This holistic perspective fills the gap between micro-level organizational dynamics and macro-level environmental influences. Given the inherent complexity of this field, a meta-framework serves as a powerful tool for scholars and practitioners. It empowers them to develop more effective strategies for managing organizational change, fostering innovation, and adapting to dynamic market environments, ultimately leading to significant benefits.

Secondly, the meta-framework functions as a methodological bridge between theoretical concepts and empirical observations in evolutionary firm analysis. It provides a structured framework for organizing diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiries. This equips researchers with a standardized vocabulary of core concepts and essential terms necessary for constructing causal explanations. This systematic methodology fosters rigor and coherence in research endeavors, enabling clearer interpretations of empirical findings and propelling the advancement of theoretical developments concerning firm behavior.

Thirdly, the meta-framework facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing a shared language and conceptual framework for scholars and practitioners across diverse disciplinary backgrounds. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, the meta-framework encourages the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers, fostering innovative insights and perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly important for addressing complex research questions that necessitate multifaceted analyses drawing from multiple knowledge domains.

Fourth, the inherent step-by-step procedural method employed in constructing the meta-framework ensures a high level of transparency, thus allowing for a clear delineation of the systematic processes guiding data analysis, from descriptive elucidation to explanatory inference. This transparency extends to the researchers' interpretative efforts, ensuring a traceable trajectory of analytical insights throughout any study related to firm behavior.

Fifth, unlike other qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, constructing a meta-framework adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby accommodation to a wider range of data types and research contexts [@goldsmith2021using; @gale2013using]. This flexibility is critical for our investigation, as we utilize primary and secondary data from both conceptual and empirical studies across the natural and social sciences. By integrating insights from diverse disciplinary domains, we aim to offer a comprehensive perspective, transcending disciplinary boundaries to gain a nuanced understanding of evolutionary firm dynamics.

In conclusion, the creation of a meta-framework represents a methodological innovation that aligns perfectly with the research objectives of this study. Our meta-framework offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to the evolutionary analysis of the firm, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, enhancing theoretical development, and ultimately contributing to the advancement of evolutionary economics.
