# Methodology

The construction of a robust meta-framework requires a systematic, step-by-step approach for synthesizing diverse data and existing frameworks into a cohesive and comprehensive higher-order framework. Each methodological step is designed to ensure organized, rigorous analysis and thorough synthesis of qualitative data. This approach ensures that the resulting meta-framework possesses both theoretical robustness and empirical grounding, ultimately enhancing its practical relevance and applicability. This section describes the outlines the specific steps that have been used in the construction of the firm's evolutionary meta-framework.

## Familiarization with Literature

Before delving into the detailed construction of our meta-framework, an exploratory review of the extant literature was conducted covering the fields of evolution in the natural sciences, evolutionary economics, evolutionary analysis of the firm, and related areas within the social sciences, including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science. The primary objective was to gather as many different and interdisciplinary perspectives as possible, identify knowledge gaps, grasp the current state of knowledge, and pinpoint the most pertinent theories, models, and existing related frameworks. By completing the familiarization step first, the meta-framework was built on a solid foundation of prior research, ensuring its alignment with established knowledge.

During the familiarization step, priority was given to achieving a broad understanding of relevant topics, interdisciplinary connections, and the complexity of the study area, rather than conducting an exhaustive review of all studies available in the literature. To achieve this, the familiarization encompassed high-quality articles from major peer-reviewed databases, along with books and conference proceedings, and, though not comprehensive, effectively identified key themes, recurring patterns, and emerging controversies in the field of evolutionary analysis of the firm. This approach not only enabled the initial mapping of the intellectual landscape but also supported the formulation of the research questions and objectives. Furthermore, it provided valuable insights into the diverse perspectives and frameworks of the last two centuries in the field of evolutionary studies.

## Research Questions and Objectives

Insights gained during the literature familiarization stage served as a foundation for formulating clear and focused research questions and objectives. The research questions were crafted to address the specific gaps and issues identified within the reviewed literature. This targeted approach ensures that the resulting meta-framework is well-positioned to contribute novel and valuable insights to the field of evolutionary firm analysis. Furthermore, establishing well-defined research objectives plays a critical role in maintaining focus and direction throughout the meta-framework development process. The SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) were employed to formulate these objectives, thereby providing a structured and clearly defined roadmap across the meta-framework building process.

## Specification of An A Priori Meta-Framework

The next step involved elucidating an a priori meta-framework that could serve as a baseline for the subsequent meta-framework synthesis. The process included the selection of a foundational or seminal work that comprehensively addressed the central ideas relevant to our research question. The selected work had to provide a robust theoretical and empirical basis for constructing a baseline meta-framework and serve as a reliable source for identifying the essential dimensions of evolution as a process. The seminal work chosen was from the field of evolutionary natural sciences, and the reasons were twofold. First, the work had a widespread recognition within the scientific community for its contributions to the understanding of natural evolution. Second, the work offered a valuable historical perspective on the trajectory of evolutionary thought, encompassing both mainstream and divergent ideas.

After choosing the seminal work, a thorough review was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of its core arguments, methodologies, and conclusions. During this stage, the recurring themes, significant dimensions, and the relationships between the core themes were identified. This step was critical for capturing the structure of the ideas and their interconnectedness, forming the foundation of the a priori framework. The extracted information was then organized into thematic categories. These categories were carefully aligned with the research objectives and encompassed core themes that were directly relevant to the focus of the study, as well as peripheral themes that provided valuable context or supporting insights.

After completing the categorization process, the a priori meta-framework was refined to better align its themes and relationships with the specific goals of the research. This approach ensured that the resulting a priori meta-framework was grounded in established knowledge and tailored to serve as a structured template for mapping and coding new data in subsequent stages of the meta-synthesis, thereby enhacing coherence and completeness throughout the process.

## Systematic Literature Reviews

Drawing from the literature familiarization, established research questions and objectives, and the a priori meta-framework from previous stages, a comprehensive two-pronged systematic literature review was conducted to identify new data and frameworks that either supported or expanded the a priori meta-framework. The first strand delved into the domain of evolutionary economics, with a particular focus on the analysis of firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. The second strand explored case studies that utilized evolutionary concepts and/or frameworks to investigate the dynamics of the firm. Each review employed a distinct search strategy to ensure methodological rigor and the identification of high-quality research. Both WOS and SCOPUS databases were targeted to maximize the rigor and quality of the search.

The first thematic review adopted a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant scholarship pertaining to the fundamental tenets and interconnected concepts that characterize the evolutionary view of the firm. To capture the broadest possible range of ideas and perspectives, the review employed broad search terms and an extensive time-frame. The second review focused on case studies that analyzed firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. This review encompassed articles that explicitly contained the term "evolution" and/or "evolutionary" in their titles and those that analyzed the behavior of the firm in an evolutionary way although they did not explicitly contained the term "evolution" or "evolutionary" in the title. To identify the latter, a qualitative research technique known as "pearl-growing" was employed. This technique metaphorically refers to the process of iteratively accumulating valuable "pearls" of information by expanding the search based on references, citations, or recommendations found in an initial set of identified sources. In our context, the "pearls" were found after the valuable insights gained from the references and citations included in the first systematic literature review.

## Meta-Framework Synthesis(Data Extraction and Thematic Analysis)

The next stage involved a two-step process of data extraction and analysis from selected studies. First, a systematic data extraction process was undertaken that collected relevant information from the selected studies, including verbatim quotes and key findings supported by the study data. This allowed the capture of all information necessary to address the research questions, ultimately forming a robust empirical foundation for the construction of the meta-framework.

After data extraction, all data were mapped and coded againts the a priori meta-framework established earlier. The process involved organizing the data in a meaningful manner to facilitate the identification of emerging patterns and relationships. Data coding was conducted thematically, adhering to the predefined themes identified within the a priori meta-framework, although the coding approach remained adaptable. Any relevant data that did not fit the themes of the a priori meta-framework were incorporated through an inductive approach. This allowed new themes and relationships to emerge from the data itself, ensuring the meta-analysis captured the full range of relevant information, even if it fell outside the a priori framework.

To enhance the rigor and efficiency of this process, qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti was employed. While Atlas.ti does not supplant the researcher's critical role in data analysis and interpretation, it significantly bolsters the methodological rigor, efficiency, and overall quality of the research endeavor. Atlas.ti played a key role in streamlining data management and coding tasks while also facilitating visual analysis to identify patterns, themes, and relationships that might be less apparent through strictly textual methods.

## Final Meta-Framework Specification

In the last stage of our meta-framework building process, the focus shifted towards refining the a priori meta-framework and ensuring the robustness of the meta analysis. A thorough review process was conducted to ensure the reliability and relevance of both the coding and the new themes emerging from it. This involved critical examination of the whole work, carefully evaluating each theme to ensure faithful representation of the data within or outside the scope of the a priori meta-framework. As a result, the initial a priori meta-framework was further refined and extended to achieve a more accurate reflection of the extracted data.

Next, the relationships between the new themes and the a priori themes were reexamined to generate meaningful insights into how they interact and influence one another. This interpretation, grounded in both the empirical data and the original a priori meta-framework, led to a revised conceptual meta-framework that provides a coherent and comprehensive explanation of the evolutionary behavior of the firm.

By adhering to these systematic steps, a final meta-framework was formulated, characterized by both rigor and adaptability. The meta-framework offers valuable insights that contribute to our understanding of evolutionary firm behavior. The transparent, comprehensive, and empirically grounded approach employed in its development ensures the meta-framework's robustness as a tool for advancing both theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of evolutionary firm analysis. Notably, the final meta-framework integrates the a priori themes with those newly identified during the systematic literature reviews. This comprehensive model captures the full spectrum of relevant themes and their interrelationships, providing a nuanced and detailed understanding of the studied concepts, relations, and data.
