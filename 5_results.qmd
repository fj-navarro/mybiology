## Choosing a Knowledge Baseline

Unlike traditional meta-framework synthesis approaches, which typically require extensive literature reviews, consultations, and deep topic expertise to develop an a priori framework, our approach focused on selecting a seminal work from the existing literature that thoroughly addressed the key concepts and relationships defining evolution in the natural sciences. This reference work provided a foundational knowledge base for elucidating our a priori framework, simplifying the subsequent coding and synthesis process while eliminating the need for extensive preparatory efforts. 

The selected work was Peter J. Bowler's seminal book, "Evolution: The History of an Idea" [-@bowler2009evolution], which examines the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding the development of economic systems. Bowler's interdisciplinary perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic processes as evolving systems shaped by continuous change. His analysis provides valuable insights for evolutionary economics by uncovering the historical origins of evolutionary ideas and their relevance to economic analysis.

Bowler’s work is also relevant to our research for its exploration of the interplay between cultural, scientific, and anthropological factors in shaping evolutionary theories. In the book, the author traces the development of evolutionary thought from its origins in ancient Greece to its modern understanding, highlighting how societal beliefs and values influenced these concepts. His insights are particularly valuable for evolutionary economists, as it underscores the importance of understanding the cultural and ideological contexts in which economic systems emerge and evolve.

The author delves into the diverse contributions of key figures to evolutionary thought, examining the ideas and theories of prominent thinkers and highlighting their impact on the evolution of the field. Understanding this intellectual lineage enriches our a priori meta-framework by offering valuable insights into the historical foundations of contemporary economic theories and methodologies. Bowler’s analysis further emphasizes the diversity of perspectives within evolutionary thought, providing a wide array of ideas to inform the analysis of evolutionary economic systems.

Ultimately, Bowler's book explores the controversies and debates surrounding the concept of evolution, highlighting the different interpretations and challenges to evolutionary theory throughout history. This aspect is particularly relevant for constructing our a priori meta-framework, as it emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of economic evolution. By examining historical debates over evolutionary theory, our a priori meta-framework gains a deeper appreciation for the contested nature of economic processes and the diverse array of factors that shape them. Bowler's nuanced analysis encourages critical engagement with evolutionary concepts and methodologies, fostering a more robust and interdisciplinary approach to studying economic systems.

In conclusion, Bowler's comprehensive treatise on evolution provides a robust foundation for understanding key themes in evolution and aggregate dimensions, serving as the baseline for elucidating our a priori meta-framework.

## Elucidating the A Priori Meta-Framework

The a priori framework is a preliminary conceptual structure developed before the main meta-synthesis process begins. It serves as a foundation for organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data in a systematic manner. The main components of the a priori meta-framework include:

1.    **Themes**: Broad, overarching concepts and categories that capture key aspects of evolutionary natural processes. Each theme and categories encapsulate essential aspects of evolutionary theory, illuminating the intricate mechanisms governing evolution and evolutionary behavior. 

2.    **Relationships**: Connections or interactions between the identified themes, illustrating how they influence or depend on each other.  

3.    **Guiding Structure**: A logical template or model that directs data mapping and coding during the synthesis process, ensuring coherence and alignment with the research objectives.  

By providing a structured starting point, the a priori framework serves as a template for coding data extracted during the literature review in the later stages of this research.

The resulting a priori meta-framework contains the following key themes and relationships (Fig. 1):

### Unit of analysis

In evolutionary studies, the unit of analysis represents the fundamental entity on which observations and analyses are centered. Historically, this focus has shifted over time. Initially, attention was directed toward the organism --defined in biology as an individual living entity, such as a plant, animal, or microorganism capable of independent existence and reproduction. Later, the emphasis shifted to populations and, following the modern synthesis, to genes. Identifying the primary unit of analysis within each system under investigation is a critical first step for evolutionary analysts and a foundational element of the analytical process.

**Despite the aforementioned shifts in the locus of analysis, the individual** organism remains a cornerstone in evolutionary studies, representing a single, discrete entity within a given population. However, distinguishing between the individual organism and the population as units of analysis is crucial for any evolutionary study. The individual organism represents a single instance of life, while the population comprises a group of organisms of the same species occupying a defined geographical area and sharing genetic similarities. The individual organism serves as the building block of the population, with its traits, behaviors, and adaptations contributing to the collective dynamics of the population. This fundamental differentiation between individual and population units of analysis can be illustrated in Darwin's theory, which encompasses both types of units. Natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism, influencing the frequencies of traits within a population over time.

The selection of a specific unit of analysis significantly influences the scope and focus of evolutionary approaches. Analyzing individual organisms allows researchers to examine specific traits, behaviors, and adaptations within a single entity, providing insights into microevolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. Conversely, studying populations enables researchers to investigate macroevolutionary patterns and trends, such as speciation and diversification, by considering the collective dynamics and genetic variability within and between populations. While the individual organism offers granularity in understanding the mechanisms of evolutionary change at a local level, the population provides a broader perspective on the dynamics of species evolution and adaptation over time. Both units of analysis are integral to comprehensively elucidating the complexities of evolution within natural systems. They highlight the interplay between individual-level characteristics and population-level dynamics in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species.

### Origin

The emergence of a population from individuals significantly shapes the evolutionary trajectory of the natural system. Therefore, investigating the origin of individuals is paramount in evolutionary analysis, as it addresses fundamental inquiries regarding the emergence, diversification, distribution, and persistence of life forms on Earth. This line of inquiry involves examining evidence from the past to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the origination and divergence of new species from common ancestors. Subsequently, attention shifts towards understanding the trend towards increased complexity and the underlying forces driving this evolutionary trend.

The concept of "origin" in evolutionary studies is closely intertwined with that of "generation" and “developmental processes”, collectively enhancing our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. While the study of "origin" focuses on the emergence of new species or lineages, marking the beginning of their subsequent evolutionary trajectory and setting the stage for evolutionary change within populations, the study of "generation" concerns the production of offspring or new individuals within a population. In essence, while the study of "origin" examines how new species arise and diverge from common ancestors, the study of "generation" delves into the mechanisms by which new individuals are generated and their contributions to genetic variation and evolutionary change within populations. Thus, an examination of reproductive processes and their impacts on population and species dynamics becomes essential.

Ultimately, "developmental" constraints also play a key role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of individuals and populations. Embryonic development imposes constraints on the types of changes organisms can undergo over time, highlighting the integral role of embryological processes within evolutionary systems. Exploring the patterns and constraints of embryonic development provides valuable insights into the mechanisms propelling evolutionary change and diversification in natural systems.

### Evolutionary vs Change process

Evolutionary processes involve dynamic mechanisms that drive changes at the population level across successive generations. Instead of acting solely on individual organisms, these mechanisms accumulate inherited changes within populations. Studying evolution at the population level provides insights into broad patterns of genetic variation, selection pressures, and the processes of speciation. Key to this analysis is gene flow, which facilitates the spread of advantageous traits and genetic diversity among populations. Conversely, isolation mechanisms like geographic or reproductive barriers restrict gene flow, promoting genetic differentiation and potentially leading to the emergence of new species through speciation. Natural selection operates on this genetic variation, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction in specific environments. Genetic drift and mutation further contribute to population dynamics, offering insights into overarching evolutionary patterns and collective population dynamics.

At the core of evolutionary theory also lies the change process occurring at the level of individual organisms or units. These changes encompass phenotypic, behavioral, or genetic mutations that occur in response to environmental pressures and internal dynamics. Once individual changes occur, they contribute to population genetic variation. Natural selection acts as a guiding force in this context, favoring traits that confer reproductive advantages or enhance survival in specific ecological niches. This selective process, influenced by environmental factors, determines the organism's adaptation and reproductive success, thereby impacting its chances of survival. Over successive generations, advantageous traits increase in prevalence within populations, while less favorable traits diminish in frequency.

An evolutionary approach must therefore emphasize the interplay between changes occurring at the level of individual organisms and the broader evolutionary processes operating at the population and species levels. This integrated perspective should elucidate how changes at the individual level contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of species over time. By examining the interaction between individual-level adaptations and population-level dynamics, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms driving species evolution and adaptation across diverse ecological contexts.

### Environment

The environment plays a pivotal role in shaping evolutionary processes, providing the stage upon which populations and individuals interact and adapt. Within natural systems, the environment encompasses a spectrum of biotic and abiotic factors that influence species distribution, behavior, and evolutionary trajectories. Biotic factors involve interactions among living organisms, encompassing phenomena such as competition for resources, predation, and symbiotic relationships. Abiotic factors, on the other hand, include non-living elements like climate, geography, and physical resources. Together, these factors contribute to the dynamic complexity of ecosystems, demanding species to continuously adapt for survival and reproduction.

In addition to these environmental factors, evolutionary processes are driven by a series of exogenous and endogenous dynamic forces, each with varying intensities and directional impacts. Exogenous forces originate from external sources beyond individual organisms or ecosystems, such as climatic fluctuations, geological events, and rare phenomena like asteroid impacts. These external influences exert significant effects on habitats, species distributions, and overall evolutionary trajectories by modifying environmental conditions and triggering evolutionary responses. Conversely, endogenous forces arise from within organisms or ecosystems or result from interactions among organisms. These forces encompass genetic mutations, physiological responses, and ecological interactions within populations or ecosystems, shaping genetic compositions and population dynamics over time. Environmental forces and conditions are pivotal in determining organism fitness, steering natural selection, and molding evolutionary paths. This process compels species to develop traits and behaviors tailored to their environmental niche, thereby increasing their chances of survival and reproductive success.

Both factors and forces coexist synergistically, each playing complementary roles: factors establish the foundational conditions and contexts for life, including environmental conditions and biological interactions, while forces actively drive evolutionary changes within these established contexts. Factors thus create the stage upon which evolutionary dynamics unfold, while forces shape the evolutionary paths by influencing genetic diversity and population-level adaptations over successive generations. Therefore, comprehending the complex interplay between environmental factors and dynamic forces is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving ecosystem evolution over time. This understanding is crucial for unraveling species adaptation, biodiversity patterns, and the resilience of ecosystems in response to environmental changes and disturbances.

Ultimately, the environment is bounded by its historical trajectory. Past events such as environmental disturbances and climatic shifts leave enduring impacts on ecosystems, influencing species composition, habitat availability, and biodiversity patterns. Ecosystems with long histories often exhibit greater biodiversity and genetic resilience, while disturbances can create legacies that restrict adaptation. Integrating historical perspectives into evolutionary analysis provides valuable insights into path-dependent processes, informing conservation strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.

### Phenotypic traits

The structural and behavioral traits of individual organisms are fundamental to evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. Structural traits include physical characteristics such as morphology, anatomy, and physiology, which determine an organism's form and function. These traits are crucial for the adaptation of organisms to their environment and their interactions with other species. Behavioral traits, on the other hand, encompass actions and responses exhibited by organisms in their environment, including feeding behaviors, mating rituals, communication signals, and social interactions.

The interplay between structural and behavioral traits shapes the ecological niche occupied by organisms and determines their fitness within a given environment. Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the emergence, loss, or modification of traits, thereby shaping the organism's overall adaptive strategy. By examining the morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of organisms, valuable insights can be gained into the strategies employed by species, the dynamics of ecological communities, and the co-evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity over time.

### Adaptation

Adaptation is a fundamental mechanism driving evolutionary change at the individual level within natural systems. Organisms continuously adjust their traits, behaviors, and physiological processes in response to selective pressures exerted by the environment. At its core, adaptation enables organisms to enhance their fitness and survival in specific ecological niches. Through the process of natural selection, individuals with traits that confer a reproductive advantage or improve survival under prevailing environmental conditions are more likely to pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, increasing their overall fitness and resilience to environmental challenges.

Adaptation occurs through various mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, genetic mutations, and behavioral adjustments. Phenotypic plasticity allows traits to adjust to environmental cues, while mutations introduce genetic variation. Behavioral adaptations optimize resource use, predator avoidance, and reproduction. Understanding adaptation at the individual level is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and species diversification within natural systems. It can also shed light on species' adaptive strategies, the emergence of novel traits, and the dynamics of ecological interactions along a period of time.

### Heredity

Heredity refers to the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, playing a central role in evolutionary processes. Genetic material, encoded in DNA molecules, contains the instructions for an organism's development, growth, and functioning. The mechanisms of heredity involve the replication and transmission of genetic material through processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Genetic variation arises from mutations, genetic recombination, and other mechanisms, leading to differences in traits among individuals within populations. Understanding heredity is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change, as it influences the diversity, adaptation, and persistence of species over time.

Heredity is linked to reproduction as it governs the transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. This connection is vital because heredity, through the transmission of DNA, ensures the continuity of genetic traits across generations, providing the raw material for evolutionary change. Additionally, genetic variation resulting from mutations and recombination during reproduction introduces diversity within populations, fueling the process of natural selection and facilitating adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Thus, investigating the relationship between heredity and reproduction is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that underpin individual change processes and their broader implications for evolutionary dynamics within natural systems.

### Reproduction

Reproduction is a fundamental process driving evolutionary dynamics at the individual level. Through the production of offspring, organisms perpetuate their genetic lineage and pass on hereditary traits, ensuring the continuity of life and preserving genetic diversity within populations. Both sexual and asexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation, enriching the population's genetic pool. Various factors, including mate choice, mating behaviors, reproductive timing, and reproductive success, influence the reproductive process, thereby impacting the genetic composition and evolutionary trajectory of species.

Modern evolutionary theory emphasizes reproductive success as the primary driver of selection, with the ability to transmit genetic information to offspring being paramount. This shift towards a focus on reproductive success has led to increased research on sexual selection and reproductive mechanisms, including the role of geographic barriers in species diversification. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for comprehending evolutionary processes in both natural and other systems. However, this perspective has faced criticism, notably from Stephen Jay Gould, who argued against it [-@gould2002structure]. Ultimately, examining the reproductive process at the individual level is key to generating insights into the adaptive strategies employed by species, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the evolutionary forces influencing populations over time.

### Variation

In evolutionary science, "variation" refers to the diversity of traits and characteristics observed within populations, shaped by underlying genetic and environmental factors. Understanding variation is integral to the study of populations as it reveals the range of phenotypic and genotypic differences within and among species. Variation is intrinsically linked to competition and selection, as individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits to future generations. This differential reproductive success propagates favorable traits over successive generations, driving evolutionary change.

Moreover, variation is closely connected to the concept of mutation, which introduces new genetic variants into populations. While not all mutations result in significant changes, with many being neutral, some can lead to notable phenotypic differences that may confer advantages or disadvantages. The evolutionary analyst will need to consider the role of the environment in determining which mutated traits spread within a population and which do not.

### Competition

Competition is a fundamental force driving evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. It arises when organisms vie for limited resources such as food, water, or territory. This competitive pressure favors traits that provide a competitive edge, leading to evolutionary changes over time and the inheritance of these beneficial traits by offspring. Within populations, competition manifests in various forms, including direct competition for resources, interference competition through aggressive interactions, and exploitative competition where one species outcompetes another for resources. These competitive interactions can lead to niche differentiation strategies, where species partition resources to reduce competition and coexist within the same habitat. Additionally, competition can drive evolutionary innovation and adaptation, as species evolve traits and behaviors to outcompete rivals. This dynamic can result in the diversification of species and the development of complex ecological interactions over evolutionary timescales.

Ultimately, competition sets the stage for natural selection to act. It results in the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, while less advantageous traits are outcompeted and reduced in frequency. Understanding competition dynamics is therefore crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind species interactions, community dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories in natural ecosystems. Through the study of competitive interactions and their consequences, the evolutionary analyst can gain insights into the processes shaping biodiversity, ecological resilience, and ecosystem stability.

### Selection

Selection mechanisms operate on the diversity of individual units, favoring traits that confer competitive advantages and improve survival. These processes are crucial drivers of evolutionary change. Natural selection, a primary mechanism, favors traits that improve an organism's fitness and reproductive success in a given environment. Through this process, individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on their genetic material to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits within populations, driving evolutionary adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

However, although natural selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, selection operates through various mechanisms, including directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection. Directional selection shifts traits towards one extreme, stabilizing selection maintains the status quo within a population, and disruptive selection leads to divergence. Understanding these selection processes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and biodiversity within natural systems.
