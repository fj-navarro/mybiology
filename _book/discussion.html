<h2 data-number="5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-use-of-a-synthesis-method"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> The Use of a Synthesis Method</h2>
<p><em>There are arguments about whether it is feasible or acceptable to conduct syntheses of qualitative evidence at all,41 and whether it is acceptable to synthesise qualitative studies derived from different traditions. The distinctions, tensions and conflicts between these have been vividly described.@dixon2005synthesising</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps even more likely to generate controversy are attempts to synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence. It is evident from the discussion above that synthesis of diverse forms of evidence will generally involve conversion of qualitative data into quantitative form or vice versa. <span class="citation" data-cites="dixon2005synthesising">Dixon-Woods et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-dixon2005synthesising" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span></em></p>
<p><em>Should reviews start with a well-defined question and how many papers are required? The issue of questions is an important one for syntheses. It will be clear that the methods described above will be more suited to some questions than others: for example questions concerning causality may be better suited to qualitative comparative analysis than questions concerned with the production of mid-range theory, which might be better suited to meta-ethnography. The issue of how questions should be identified and formulated in the first instance is one on which there is much uncertainty.</em></p>
<p><em>Estabrooks et al, like many in the systematic review community, argue that review questions should be selected to focus on similar populations or themes.43 However, others point out that in primary qualitative research, definitions of the phenomenon emerge from the data.15 Whether one should start with an a priori definition of the phenomenon for purposes of a secondary synthesis is therefore an important question.@dixon2005synthesising</em></p>
<p><em>A related issue is how to limit the number of papers included in the review. One approach is to narrow the focus. An alternative strategy is offered by theoretical sampling, used in primary qualitative research with a view towards the evolving development of the concepts. Sampling continues until theoretical saturation is reached, where no new relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category, either to extend or contradict it.45 It has been suggested that this approach would also be suitable for selecting papers for inclusion in reviews.46–48 However, the application of this form of sampling has been rarely tested empirically, and some express anxiety that this may result in the omission of relevant data, thus limiting the understanding of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs. <span class="citation" data-cites="dixon2005synthesising">Dixon-Woods et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-dixon2005synthesising" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span></em></p>
<p><u><em>Appraising studies for inclusion</em></u> <em>The issue of how or whether to appraise qualitative papers for inclusion in a review has received a great deal of attention. The NHS CRD guidance emphasises the need for a structured approach to quality assessment for qualitative studies to be included in reviews, but also recognises the difficulties of achieving consensus on the criteria that might constitute quality standards.5 Some argue that weak papers should be excluded. Others, however, propose that papers should not be excluded for reasons of quality, particularly where this might result in synthesisers discounting important studies for the sake of ‘surface mistakes’, which are distinguished from fatal mistakes that invalidate the finding.Published examples include reviews that have chosen not to appraise the papers,14 as well as those which have opted to appraise the papers using a formalised approach.22 If the argument prevails that some quality appraisal is necessary, the problem then arises as to how this should be undertaken. <span class="citation" data-cites="dixon2005synthesising">Dixon-Woods et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-dixon2005synthesising" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span></em></p>
<p><em>Conclusions</em> <em>There is an urgent need for rigorous methods for synthesising evidence of diverse types generated by diverse methodologies. These methods are required to meet the needs of policy-makers and practitioners, who need to be able to benefit from the range of evidence available. <span class="citation" data-cites="dixon2005synthesising">Dixon-Woods et al.

<p>One of the practical benefits derived from the present proposal of formulating an evolutionary systems analytical framework is to determine the need to have professionals with an evolutionary analyst profile. An evolutionary analyst is understood to be an academic or professional who has a clear and deep understanding of the evolutionary functioning of systems and who is capable of using rigorous analysis and tools to determine the factors that explain their essence and elements of change.</p>

<p>If we are able to acquire a deep understanding of the functioning of the evolutionary system, its components, behaviors and flow of changes, we can then better foresee in which direction the evolutionary system is moving and glimpse whether the system has the capacity to survive or, on the contrary, is doomed to disappearance.</p>
<p>It is worth considering the possibility of whether, based on increasingly deeper knowledge of the evolution of a system, it would be possible to act on the future of the system. In other words, if it could be feasible to design your own plan and carry it out based on the knowledge generated about the evolution of the system.</p>
<p>To what extent is the system under observation random in change or does it evidence a logic that can be known and even altered based on our desires or needs?</p>

<p>If they were really able to manipulate the system as we wish, on what elements would it be most feasible to do so? Would it be possible to act on both the structural and behavioral elements, only on one of them? Being able to act on a known evolutionary system would open new and great opportunities to design systems that meet a wide diversity of needs.</p>
<p>The above would necessarily entail having to assess the ethical problems of altering the course of nature and the new problems that would emerge by distorting the natural mechanisms of the functioning of life and society. The opposite position would be to conclude that the system is unalterable and we cannot intelligently design it to satisfy our desires.</p>
<p>Society would go from a stage in which social systems are considered elusive to another in which we would be able to know to what extent their evolution is random, to what extent there is causality and to what extent they are programmable.</p>

<p>An evolutionary analysis framework can serve to inform who cannot support themselves, namely, who is more likely to survive and continue competitive, and who is threatened by disappearance.</p>
<p>Identifying who dominates over whom, that is, elucidating the relationships and power structures has great significance, but it is also a way to understand how species advance. In fact, the process of replacement or extinction of species is an essential aspect to understand human progress.</p>
<p>The level at which the analyst expects to inform policy, or the level of contribution expected by decision makers from an evolutionary model, is a factor in determining the level of analysis to be used in the “struggle for existence.”</p>
<p>Additionally, if education (education policies) could improve individuals, the benefits could perhaps be passed on through inheritance (this is a Lamarckian view).</p>

<p>From the RQs: Another question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual <strong>permits the struggle</strong> to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.</p>
<p>This leads us to the recommendation, in some circumstances mediated by policies, that the struggle does not have constraints that condition it. Thus, as the environment continues to pose challenges that must be faced (resolved) by the individual, progress will continues.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-evolution"><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1</span> On Evolution</h3>
<p>When addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what <strong>the unit</strong> of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied. This is a discussion that has changed over time, having moved from the individual organism to what is currently considered a more correct approach, the gene. What the above means is that instead of prioritizing “adaptive fitness” in the analysis, today it seems more appropriate to focus on the reproductive success of the individual. This new perspective has given rise to the movement of ultra-Darwinism.</p>
<p>The analysis of evolutionary <strong>stratigraphy</strong>, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.</p>
<p>The geological <strong>law of superposition</strong>, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.</p>

<p>The idea of hierarchy involves something on top down to somethinge else.</p>
<p>Once the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.</p>

<h4 data-number="5.6.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classification"><span class="header-section-number">5.6.1.2</span> Classification</h4>
<p>A classification or taxonomy is a procedure used to better understand the diversity (and variation) of organisms.</p>
<p>When studying the evolution of a population, building a <strong>classification or taxonomy</strong> of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through.</p>
<p>With a classification or taxonomy the analyst can study the diversity of the units (species) based e.g.&nbsp;in their morphology, as well as the ecological relationships that exist between them.</p>
<p>In the history of evolution, three major frameworks for classifying species are usually proposed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Chain of being (Bonnet) -&gt; it is a hierarchical chain of relationships</li>
<li>The rope of being (Rubinet)</li>
<li>Lineo taxonomy based on visible resemblances (with no hierarchy)</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea of the Origin is consubstantially associated with the idea of an <strong>end</strong>, since everything that begins must necessarily have an end.</p>
<p>The problem of origin is closed related to the <strong>problem of generation</strong>, thus the evolutionary analyst must elucidate whether the origin of the unit is spontaneous, preformationist, etc.</p>
<p>An alternative perspective to the problem of origin can be raised from <strong>biogenesis</strong> (life arising from non-living matter) and the <strong>“primordial soup”</strong> (Opsin), that is, the combination of elements that gives rise to the synthesis of compounds ” organic” after adding energy to the system (from lightning, UVA radiation, volcanic activity, etc.)</p>

<p>We do not know the forces (and their sources) that operate driving the process of change in the individuals of a population.</p>
<p>Apart from the forces that operate at the level of individuals, it is necessary to know what the transmission mechanisms are like from the environment to the individual, between individuals, and vice versa, from the individual to the environment.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult questions that every evolutionary analyst must face is how the <strong>selection process</strong> imposed by the environment actually work, and to what extent different alternative selection approaches can help explain the evolutionary course of the system.</p>
<p>We refer to the selection process not as the blind application of a closed paradigm that we know a priori will provide an explanatory response to the evolution of any system, but rather the analyst evaluates to what degree alternative selection models can provide insight into our understanding of the evolution of the system. It is about better understanding how rival visions can have a place in our understanding of the evolutionary phenomena of the system, even in an open and simultaneous way.</p>

<p>To what extent is the system’s behavior governed by inherited <strong>instincts</strong>? And to what extent can the selection process alter instincts? Are instincts constraints to the development of behavior and the process of change, or are they not such constraints?</p>
<p>What behavioral traits can be considered <strong>innate</strong> and which are constructed with the interaction with the natural and social environment? What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?</p>
<p>Perhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.</p>
<p>Can individual behavior be <strong>predicted</strong>? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.</p>
<p>To what extent can <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?</p>
<p>The problem of <strong>hierarchy</strong> can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g.&nbsp;intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?</p>
<p>It is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to <strong>control genes</strong> and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)</p>

<h3 data-number="5.6.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-change"><span class="header-section-number">5.6.5</span> On Change</h3>
<p>We know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the <strong>historical past</strong> as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.</p>
<p>If change does not leave any <strong>proof</strong> (of evolution), why don’t we seek indirect progress (i.e.&nbsp;the equivalent of fossils)?</p>
<p>It is necessary to know which components of the individual’s structure (or flows) the <strong>forces of the environment</strong> act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.</p>
<p>Also relevant is the question of how the <strong>development process</strong> of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.</p>
<p>Does the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any <strong>goal or objective</strong>? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual’s process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g.&nbsp;a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?</p>
<p>In the analysis of <strong>evolutionary dynamics</strong>, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.</p>
<p>What are the <strong>change mechanisms</strong> used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hybridization</li>
<li>Recombination</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>To what extent is the <strong>timeline</strong> for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.</p>
<p>Speaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary <strong>“clock”</strong> of the system. The idea of the clock is to explain traits that evolve at a constant rate overtime, due to underlying molecular mechanisms. In other words, that would explain the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time.</p>
<p>It is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.</p>
<p>A possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as <strong>punctuated equilibria”</strong>. According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis.</p>
<p>The evolutionary analyst should open to the notion of <strong>arrow of time</strong>, and the preferred direction or sequence of change. And if the change process is reversible vs irreversible (with higher entropy). In turn, this should lead the analyst to consider the predictability or unpredictability of evolution.</p>
<p>Is the result of evolution the same system of a new one?</p>
