<p>The author employed a systematic approach that leveraged existing works in the domain of natural sciences to construct a preliminary evolutionary framework. This framework served as a foundation for streamlining the identification, coding, and synthesis of data from studies in the domain of evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm. By leveraging those relevant concepts, theories, and models present in key evolution-centered works in the field of natural science, the author achieved a more efficient means of establishing an a priori framework. This facilitated the testing of existing theories and models in evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm against our preliminary criteria.</p>
<p>Moreover, this methodological choice served as a pragmatic alternative to other forms of qualitative data synthesis. By flagging and communicating divergent findings or themes along the meta-framework construction process, the author ensured transparency and facilitated discussion around the synthesized findings. The resulting synthetic product is an enhanced framework that captures the key theories and concepts under study, and associations between themes and tensions identified in the literature. This comprehensive approach enhances the rigor and reliability of the methodological process <span class="citation" data-cites="carroll2011worked">(<a href="references.html#ref-carroll2011worked" role="doc-biblioref">Carroll, Booth, and Cooper 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The approach employed in this study diverges from conventional methods utilized in framework synthesis. Unlike other published versions, where the a priori framework is typically developed through extensive literature review, consultations, and topic expertise, our approach does not require such exhaustive processes beforehand. Instead, the author started from a corpus of pre-existing literature and a seminal work that contained the key concepts and the relationships between them in the adjacent field of natural sciences. This foundation allowed for a faster and more efficient coding and synthesis process compared to traditional meta-framework construction methods. By circumventing the need for extensive preparatory work, our approach offers a more efficient and streamlined method for conducting framework synthesis, enabling authors to focus more directly on the review process itself.</p>
<section id="objectives" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Objectives</h2>
<p>The present study delineates a comprehensive meta-framework designed to fulfill several pivotal objectives. Foremost among these aims is the systematic description and synthesis of primary and secondary data, incorporating an examination of the fundamental interrelationships inherent within. Concurrently, the meta-framework endeavors to map the evolutionary trajectory of pertinent studies in the domain of business scholarship and the theory of the firm, aligning them methodically within its overarching structure.</p>
<p>The meta-framework aspires to transcend conventional paradigms of data synthesis, aspiring instead to furnish a novel interpretive lens through which to scrutinize the theory of the firm from an evolutionary standpoint. By foregrounding the dynamic interplay between firms and their milieu, this endeavor represents a departure from static conceptualizations, facilitating a nuanced understanding of organizational behavior within an ever-changing economic landscape.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the meta-framework to engender a tangible utility for both academic scholars and industry practitioners alike. Hence, the resultant synthesis is envisaged as a flexible tool, amenable to facilitating a deeper comprehension of firm-level decision-making processes and behavioral dynamics. In effect, the meta-framework is envisaged to serve as a practical aid, fostering enhanced insights and efficacious strategies pertinent to scholarly inquiry and managerial practice within the realm of business economics.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-framework" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-framework"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What is a Framework?</h2>
<p>Although there is no standard, universal definition of what a framework is from a qualitative research standpoint, the literature in general endorses the position of frameworks as bridges between the construction of theories and the way of conducting empirical observations <span class="citation" data-cites="partelow2023framework mollinga2008rational">(<a href="references.html#ref-partelow2023framework" role="doc-biblioref">Partelow 2023</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-mollinga2008rational" role="doc-biblioref">Mollinga 2008</a>)</span>. This relevant position of frameworks within the theory of science is in turn reflected in the growth they have experienced in recent decades, to the point of being present in practically all areas of scientific knowledge. Its applications span wide and varied fields within the natural and social sciences, technological development, and environmental and experimental sciences, and many well-established frameworks are regularly applied by scientific organizations and policymakers around the world.</p>
<p>In some cases, frameworks act as valuable tools that help develop a common language and structure research processes <span class="citation" data-cites="binder2013comparison">(<a href="references.html#ref-binder2013comparison" role="doc-biblioref">Binder et al. 2013</a>)</span>. In other cases they serve as reference material used by scholars and practitioners to navigate the complex interactions between phenomena of different nature and to analyze and integrate the knowledge that thus emerges <span class="citation" data-cites="pulver2018frontiers">(<a href="references.html#ref-pulver2018frontiers" role="doc-biblioref">Pulver et al. 2018</a>)</span>. Whatever its purpose, if we tried to classify the most used frameworks today, we would realize that there are two main trends: frameworks that aim to capture the complex functioning of a phenomenon or system, and those that seek to simplify the central concepts. This is enough to give us an idea of the importance of frameworks as tools to structure and operationalize scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>From an epistemological point of view, frameworks, whether emerging from the top down or bottom up, cover the imperative need to build a seamless connection between different levels or scales of scientific knowledge, thus linking the higher more general levels of knowledge (a paradigm or a general theory) with the bottom levels (a model or a case study). As such a framework is intended to <em>“organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="partelow2023framework">(<a href="references.html#ref-partelow2023framework" role="doc-biblioref">Partelow 2023</a>)</span>. Ultimately, frameworks aim to make science easier, guiding researchers in their research design and providing them with a groundwork of key concepts and foundational knowledge that they can then measure, compare, and evaluate. This way, researchers do not need to reinvent the wheel with each new investigation and can instead focus their skills on advancing the framework by applying it to other less-known areas, or integrating it with new knowledge from other disciplines.</p>
<p>Frameworks also help researchers position their work within a specific field of practice or knowledge, providing them with a well-grounded set of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms that have been shown to be useful in that field <span class="citation" data-cites="cox2016synthesizing">(<a href="references.html#ref-cox2016synthesizing" role="doc-biblioref">Cox et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Therefore, frameworks are not only valuable for synthesizing knowledge and focusing researchers’ attention on key concepts and its interrelationships, but they also help drive the community debate, encourage a more collaborative and interdisciplinary research work, and lay the foundation for subsequent empirical efforts and for effective communication of the advances and discoveries being made.</p>
<p>Despite the growth of framework creation in recent years and its widespread applications in science, governance and policy-making, doubts persist about their development and the way in which they can be applied. Very often frameworks are developed from the experience and knowledge of scholars and practitioners themselves. This often earns them the criticism that they act as “black boxes” and do not make clear why some concepts and their relationships are chosen and others are left out. But this is not the only way a framework can be developed. It is also quite common for prior knowledge and experience to be combined with an empirical synthesis process derived from some research, allowing frameworks to emerge in a more robust way.</p>
<p>Once a framework has been created and its applications in a field seem clear, it is time to operationalize it. This will often pose numerous challenges for both its creators and end users. For example, if the purpose of the framework is to guide empirical analysis of a particular phenomenon, scholars and practitioners will need to develop specific strategies for choosing particular cases and conducting synthesis activities. In other cases the need will arise to connect the conceptual framework or the indicators provided by the framework with real-life data. In such cases, issues may arise when interpreting the data and adjusting the framework to reality.</p>

<section id="rationale-for-a-meta-framework" class="level2" data-number="3.3">
<h2 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rationale-for-a-meta-framework"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Rationale for a Meta-Framework</h2>
<p>The adoption of a meta-framework as the principal methodological tool is underpinned by several reasons. First is the inherent suitability of framework synthesis for the analysis of descriptive data, particularly when confronted with the imperative to encapsulate the intricate structural nuances and dynamic interaction patterns characterizing the phenomenon or system under scrutiny <span class="citation" data-cites="smith2011qualitative">(<a href="references.html#ref-smith2011qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Smith and Firth 2011</a>)</span>. Given the inherent complexity intrinsic to the evolutionary inquiry into firm behavior, encompassing a multitude of internal and external variables and their interplay, a methodological approach offering a comprehensive depiction of both structural configurations and behavioral dynamics becomes imperative for elucidating this multifaceted domain.</p>
<p>Moreover, the step-by-step procedural framework inherent in synthesis methodology endows it with a commendable level of transparency, thus enabling a clear delineation of the systematic processes guiding data analysis, from descriptive elucidation to explanatory inference. This procedural transparency extends further to encompass the researchers’ interpretative endeavors, thereby ensuring a traceable trajectory of analytical insights over the course of the study.</p>
<p>Unlike alternative qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, framework analysis adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby rendering it accommodating to a diverse array of data types and research contexts <span class="citation" data-cites="goldsmith2021using gale2013using">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldsmith2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Goldsmith 2021</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gale2013using" role="doc-biblioref">Gale et al. 2013</a>)</span>. This versatility is particularly salient in the context of the present investigation, where primary data derived from conceptual and empirical studies across natural and social sciences, alongside secondary data elucidating evolutionary paradigms within the realm of firm theory, collectively underpin the construction of the meta-framework. By integrating insights from disparate disciplinary domains, the meta-framework aspires to offer a holistic vantage point, transcending disciplinary boundaries to provide a nuanced understanding of evolutionary dynamics within the context of firm behavior.</p>

<section id="stages-in-the-construction-of-the-meta-framework" class="level2" data-number="3.4">
<h2 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stages-in-the-construction-of-the-meta-framework"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Stages in the Construction of the Meta-Framework</h2>
<p>Framework analysis is a robust methodological approach that comprises five stages that facilitate systematic qualitative data analysis. Beginning with data familiarization and culminating in mapping and interpretation, these stages ensure comprehensive exploration and synthesis of research findings. Each stage plays a critical role in elucidating patterns, themes, and associations within the data, ultimately contributing to a nuanced understanding of the research topic. Notably, the framework approach’s flexibility enables adaptation to various research contexts, including longitudinal studies, case studies, and projects involving diverse participant groups. By embracing the methodological rigor inherent in framework analysis, researchers can effectively navigate the complexities of qualitative data and advance knowledge in their respective fields.</p>
<section id="stage-1-familiarization" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-1-familiarization">Stage 1: Familiarization</h3>
<p>The initial stage of meta-framework construction, familiarization, aims at providing the researcher with a purposeful understanding of the collected data. Through an immersive engagement with the dataset, researchers embark on purposeful reading and re-reading of the data, allowing them to identify key ideas, patterns, and variations, as well as recurrent themes that underpin the richness of the data that serve as the foundation for subsequent analytical endeavors. This stage is instrumental in establishing a foundational comprehension of the dataset, encompassing an exploration of major themes pertinent to the research questions and their recurrence throughout the data. Data familiarization extends until the researcher attains a comprehensive grasp of the dataset’s breadth of variation <span class="citation" data-cites="ritchie2002qualitative goldsmith2021using">(<a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2002qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Ritchie and Spencer 2002</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-goldsmith2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Goldsmith 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Specifically during the familiarization stage of our study, the author identified a seminal work from the existing literature that explored the trajectory of the evolutionary concept in the natural sciences through a historical lens <span class="citation" data-cites="bowler2003evolution">(<a href="references.html#ref-bowler2003evolution" role="doc-biblioref">Bowler 2003</a>)</span>. This work encapsulated fundamental concepts, theories, and their interrelationships over time, providing a foundational understanding of the evolutionary process within natural scientific thinking. Leveraging insights from Bowler’s work, the author conducted a comprehensive review of the dataset, thoroughly examining recurring themes, patterns, and nuances pertinent to the domain of evolution in natural science. This process ultimately led to the formulation of a preliminary framework on the theme of evolutionary natural sciences in the subsequent stage of the methodological process.</p>
</section>
<section id="stage-2-developing-a-preliminary-thematic-framework" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-2-developing-a-preliminary-thematic-framework">Stage 2: Developing a preliminary thematic framework</h3>
<p>Framework development is an iterative process that allows for refinement through testing against data subsets, enabling the progression from simple descriptions to conceptual abstractions <span class="citation" data-cites="goldsmith2021using gale2013using">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldsmith2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Goldsmith 2021</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-gale2013using" role="doc-biblioref">Gale et al. 2013</a>)</span>. The development of themes involves systematic pattern recognition, often employing techniques such as the constant comparative method <span class="citation" data-cites="gale2013using">(<a href="references.html#ref-gale2013using" role="doc-biblioref">Gale et al. 2013</a>)</span>. In practice, researchers utilize computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) to organize data and develop nuanced understandings. The emphasis lies in identifying important themes and conceptual relationships rather than detailing their manifestation in the data, allowing for flexibility in approach based on the researcher’s familiarity with the dataset and research objectives <span class="citation" data-cites="goldsmith2021using">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldsmith2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Goldsmith 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following the immersion in the data provided by Bowler’s seminal work during the familiarization stage, the author embarked on the task of developing a preliminary thematic framework focusing on the evolutionary process in the natural sciences. This stage marked the transition from data immersion to abstraction and conceptualization, aiming to identify inherent patterns and concepts within the dataset while aligning with the overarching research goals <span class="citation" data-cites="ritchie2002qualitative">(<a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2002qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Ritchie and Spencer 2002</a>)</span>. The preliminary thematic framework functioned as a scaffold, enabling the integration of new data gleaned from the evolutionary economics and theory of the firm literature, thereby facilitating ongoing refinement, expansion, or streamlining of the framework.</p>
<p>While the preliminary evolutionary framework did not perfectly align with the study’s topic, it provided a “best-fit” and relevant pre-existing themes against which to map and code data extracted from selected studies within evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm domain <span class="citation" data-cites="carroll2011worked">(<a href="references.html#ref-carroll2011worked" role="doc-biblioref">Carroll, Booth, and Cooper 2011</a>)</span>. By leveraging Bowler’s comprehensive dataset as a foundation, the author adopted an augmentative and deductive approach, capitalizing on pre-existing knowledge within the field of natural sciences rather than commencing the analysis from a blank slate. This methodological choice enabled a nuanced and more agile analysis of the literature reviewed grounded in robust theoretical foundations.</p>

<section id="stage-3-literature-search-and-selection" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-3-literature-search-and-selection">Stage 3: Literature search and selection</h3>
<p>The author employed a systematic review approach to conduct a literature search and selection specific to the domain of evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm. This involved formulating a search strategy tailored to the research questions, which required using relevant terms and filters to identify pertinent studies.</p>
<p>The search strategy incorporated specific keywords such as “EVOLUTIONARY” AND (“FIRM” OR “ENTERPRISE” OR “BUSINESS” OR “ECONOMICS”), along with filters restricting the search to only papers written in English and without any date constraints. Multiple databases, including Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science®, were systematically queried to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>
<p><strong>For inclusion in the review, studies were required to satisfy three key criteria: first, they needed to focus on exploring evolution from an economics, business, or theory of the firm perspective; second, they had to meet… And third,…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seventy-five studies meeting the established criteria were identified, forming the foundation of the review. Table 1 outlines the definitions of the three SEARCH pathways and enumerates the sub-categories of studies identified within each pathway. Alongside research papers and books on evolutionary economics, various discussion papers delineating differing conceptual frameworks, employing diverse research methodologies, and exhibiting varying degrees of connection to the theory of the firm were also discovered.</strong></p>
<p>Given the relatively low number of selected studies, a literature pearl-growing technique was additionally employed.The pearl-growing technique is a qualitative research method employed to discover supplementary sources of information or relevant studies by leveraging references, citations, or recommendations found within already identified sources. The process began after the initial literature search using databases to pinpoint relevant materials. The author then carefully reviewed the reference lists or bibliographies of these sources, paying close attention to cited sources and recommended readings. Subsequently, the identified references were utilized to unearth additional studies, articles, or books that may enrich the understanding of the topic. The iterative process involved expanding the search based on newly discovered leads until saturation was reached. The author critically evaluated the relevance of these new sources, considering their alignment with the research question and potential contribution. Finally, findings from these additional sources were integrated into the synthesis of the literature, enhancing understanding. This technique ensured the identification of diverse perspectives, theories, and findings, enriching the literature review and increasing the likelihood of uncovering significant insights <span class="citation" data-cites="petticrew2008systematic barnett2009methods">(<a href="references.html#ref-petticrew2008systematic" role="doc-biblioref">Petticrew and Roberts 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-barnett2009methods" role="doc-biblioref">Barnett-Page and Thomas 2009</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-4-indexing">Stage 4: Indexing</h3>
<p>Once the preliminary thematic framework was established and studies were selected, the author moved on to the indexing stage, a systematic process akin to creating an index for a book. This involved the application of the established framework to the studies data. In essence, the author linked the data from studies with the components of the framework by assigning relevant thematic references to passages within the textual data <span class="citation" data-cites="ritchie2002qualitative">(<a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2002qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Ritchie and Spencer 2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>During the indexing process, the author made subjective judgments regarding the meaning and significance of each passage, considering both its individual context and its broader relevance to the research. The data was coded and annotated using the Atlas.ti software, rendering the indexing process transparent and facilitating collaboration and validation within the research community. Moreover, this stage offered an opportunity for framework refinement, as the author evaluated the compatibility of the preliminary framework with the data from the selected studies. Necessary adjustments to component definitions and boundaries were made through iterative revision until all data were indexed on the final framework. Ultimately, indexing ensured the alignment between the framework and the data from the studies, thereby facilitating subsequent analysis and interpretation <span class="citation" data-cites="goldsmith2021using">(<a href="references.html#ref-goldsmith2021using" role="doc-biblioref">Goldsmith 2021</a>)</span></p>
<p>Although there were some helpful overlaps that facilitated the rapid and reliable coding of a significant portion of data from the selected studies, the preliminary framework proved inadequate in terms of depth or complexity to fully account for all the data in the included studies.</p>
<p><strong>(… lo que sigue es el ejemplo de explicación) All of these characteristics were found in the included studies to affect perceived need and decision- making. It was felt that the pre-existing theme of “personal factors” alone was insufficient to illustrate the complexity of factors at play. The role of age, gender and the physical properties of agents were new factors identified by the synthesis affecting the a priori theme of use, which were absent from the original conceptual model. <span class="citation" data-cites="carroll2011worked">Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (<a href="references.html#ref-carroll2011worked" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>(see Figure X) Very little study data were coded against the themes of “Spending capacity” (or “Costs”)and “Access: obtaining the agent”,which may reflect differences in the cultural context of the preliminary conceptual model (a low-income country in South America) compared with the studies included in the review (principally UK, Europe and North America). However, relatively more substantial amounts of data were coded against the remaining themes. <span class="citation" data-cites="carroll2011worked">Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (<a href="references.html#ref-carroll2011worked" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span></strong></p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="stage-5-charting">Stage 5: Charting</h3>
<p>Having indexed the textual data according to the thematic framework, transition to the charting phase involved consolidating individual insights into a cohesive portrayal of the data, thereby providing a holistic view of the research findings. As charting was built upon earlier decisions made in the indexing step, it allowed for revisiting and enhancing the selection and organization of units of analysis and framework components. In practice, this process involved the creation of one or more matrix-based charts aimed at summarizing the data, where rows and columns delineated units of analysis and framework components. The author established the structure of the chart, populated its cells with summarized data, and determined the appropriate level of abstraction.</p>
<p>By lifting data from its original context and rearranging it according to relevant themes, a deeper insight into <strong>the range of attitudes and experiences</strong> encapsulated within the data was gained that informed the overarching research objectives<span class="citation" data-cites="ritchie2002qualitative">(<a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2002qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Ritchie and Spencer 2002</a>)</span>. Various tools, including pen and paper, word processing programs, spreadsheets, and computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS), were utilized to create charts.</p>

<p>In the final stage of the synthesis process, the author integrated insights gleaned from preceding stages with the original research questions and emerging themes. This entailed a comprehensive review, recombination, consolidation, and condensation of charts to harmonize with the study’s focal points and predominant patterns. In this endeavor, the author’s creativity played an instrumental role in selecting the most suitable approach to effectively convey findings <span class="citation" data-cites="gale2013using ritchie2002qualitative">(<a href="references.html#ref-gale2013using" role="doc-biblioref">Gale et al. 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2002qualitative" role="doc-biblioref">Ritchie and Spencer 2002</a>)</span>.</p>
