    "title": "Towards an Integrative Meta-Framework of the Evolutionary Firm",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEvolutionary economics, especially in its endeavor to elucidate the behavior of firms, confronts notable integrative challenges that have constrained its ascension as a mainstream alternative within economics vis-à-vis classical paradigms. Central among these challenges are the dispersion, fragmentation, and reductionism inherent in the accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, the integration of evolutionary knowledge stands as a main driver for disciplinary advancement, offering a pathway to holistic comprehension, innovation stimulation, methodological enhancement, and improved applicability in policy and practice domains. In response to these impediments, a meta-framework for knowledge integration has been formulated. Rooted in foundational tenets derived from evolutionary biology, evolutionary economics, and firm-specific research, this integrated approach seeks to furnish deeper insights into the complex dynamics governing firms, while providing a more cohesive and structured comprehension of firm evolution by transcending disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this meta-framework for scholarly inquiry and practical application, while identifying prospective avenues for future research.\nKeywords: Evolutionary economics, Meta-framework, Firm behavior, Knowledge Integration."

    "text": "Evolutionary studies have greatly enhanced our comprehension of fundamental natural and social phenomena, spanning from biological evolution to cultural and societal changes. Originating from humanity’s enduring quest to understand life’s origins and development, the notion of evolution can be traced to the intellectual explorations of early civilizations in antiquity. Early inklings of transformation of species over time appear in the works of philosophers Anaximander and Empedocles, dating back to the 6th century BC (Delisle 2019; Dercole and Rinaldi 2008; Glass 1968; Himmelfarb 1968). Nonetheless, it wasn’t until the 19th century that evolutionary thought began to crystallize into a formal scientific discipline.\nCharles Darwin’s 1859 seminal work “On the Origin of Species” (1964) laid the foundation for modern evolutionary theory. Darwin proposed the mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind evolution, whereby organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to subsequent generations. This revolutionary idea sparked intense debate and controversy during and after Darwin’s own life, challenging traditional religious and philosophical beliefs about the origins of life. Notwithstanding, evolutionary thought did not solely stem from the contributions of a single man. While Darwin’s work catalyzed the formalization of evolutionary theory, its development was the result of a rich tradition and the convergence of multiple disciplines shaped by a diverse array of thinkers spanning various fields (Prestes 2023; Brake 2016; Deichmann and Travis 2010).\nEarly scholars in the tradition of evolutionary thought commonly explored patterns of change and adaptation across biological, cultural, and social contexts. Anthropologists like Herbert Spencer and Lewis Henry Morgan explored the evolution of human societies and cultures, laying the groundwork for the field of cultural evolution. Likewise, sociologists such as Émile Durkheim and Max Weber investigated social change and the evolution of institutions within societies. Moreover, the interdisciplinary character of evolutionary thought became apparent as it began incorporating insights from more diverse fields, including psychology, archaeology, and linguistics. Each discipline provided distinctive perspectives on the mechanisms and processes of change, thereby enhancing our comprehension of evolution in its widest scope.\nEvolutionary economics, akin to other evolutionary branches in the social sciences, aligned with tradition by applying principles of variation, selection, and adaptation to economic dynamics. Pioneering economists like Thorstein Veblen and Joseph Schumpeter drew parallels between biological evolution and economic processes, emphasizing innovation, competition, and adaptation’s role. The evolutionary theory of the firm, introduced in the early 1980s by Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter (1982), deepened this connection. They advocated for examining firm behavior and organizational change through the lens of principles such as variation, selection, and retention. Their approach underscored the importance of routines, capabilities, and organizational learning in shaping the evolution of firms. Additionally, evolutionary economics acknowledged historical contingency and path dependence’s importance in shaping economic outcomes. Such a perspective underscored that current economic systems result from cumulative historical processes, with past events exerting lasting influence.\nAs evolutionary theory continued to progress, shedding light on a myriad of phenomena from the origins of life to the behaviors of organisms and human societies, its potential as an integrative framework and alternative to classical thought remains unrealized. This is especially evident in evolutionary economics, where despite continuous efforts to integrate evolutionary principles into economic theory, the field remains on the periphery of the economics profession, largely overshadowed by the dominance of neoclassical models in mainstream economics. An important critique concerns perceived deficiencies in formalization and integration within the field. Furthermore, evolutionary economics confronts contemporary challenges, including those stemming from technological advances, environmental sustainability concerns, and geoeconomic disparities. These challenges are amplified by increasing demands for evolutionary economic principles to inform policy responses to disruptive changes, thereby intensifying scrutiny of the field’s efficacy in addressing a wide array of issues, including innovation policies, industrial strategies, and environmental regulations.\nThis article aims to advance the formalization and integration of evolutionary thinking in the study of firms as dynamic, living entities. By constructing a meta-framework, this research seeks to consolidate the core structural components and their interconnections into a comprehensive analytical model of the evolutionary firm. The effort is designed to address existing barriers that hinder the effective application of evolutionary thinking by scholars and practitioners. Ultimately, the goal is to deepen our understanding of firms and their behavioral dynamics.\nThe subsequent sections fulfill distinct objectives to achieve this aim: Section 1 establishes the foundation by delineating the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and its integration into economics, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of evolutionary studies. Section 2: Summary of Weaknesses in the Literature identifies and discusses the main weaknesses in the existing literature pertaining to evolutionary analysis of firms, providing a critical overview of the current state of evolutionary economics research. Section 3: Description and Explanation of the Evolutionary Framework from Biology utilizes Bowler’s “Evolution” book as a reference to elucidate the components and main relationships of the evolutionary framework from biology, establishing the theoretical underpinnings for subsequent analysis. Section 4: Construction of a Meta-framework for the Evolutionary Analysis of the Firm proposes a meta-framework tailored to the analysis of firms, integrating insights from evolutionary economics and related fields to provide a comprehensive approach to studying firm behavior. Section 5: Discussion of the Main Consequences of the Meta-framework explores and discusses the implications of the proposed meta-framework for evolutionary analysis of firms, elucidating its potential contributions to scholarly inquiry and practical application. Section 6: Limitations and Future Lines of Research acknowledges the limitations of the research conducted and outlines potential avenues for future research in evolutionary economics and the analysis of firm behavior. Finally, Section 7: Conclusion offers a succinct summary of the main contributions of the paper, highlighting the significance of the proposed meta-framework and suggesting directions for further exploration in the field of evolutionary economics.\n\n\n\n\nBrake, Mark. 2016.

    "section": "2.1 Knowledge Dispersion",
    "text": "2.1 Knowledge Dispersion\nKnowledge dispersion refers to the widespread distribution of information across diverse sources, disciplines, and domains. It reflects the multiplicity of perspectives, theories, and methodologies that exist within different areas of knowledge. Dispersion in evolutionary studies of the firm is evident in the varied insights found across the numerous subfields, publications, and researchers.\nEach discipline offers specialized insights into distinct aspects of firm behavior—spanning organizational structures, management practices, leadership dynamics, technological advancements, and more. Together, these contributions form a rich tapestry of perspectives aimed at enhancing our broader understanding of the firm within the academic landscape. However, in such a dispersed environment, knowledge takes on different forms and becomes accessible primarily to individuals within specific fields, fostering information asymmetry between disciplines. Experts within their domains can readily access and utilize relevant knowledge, while those outside these fields often encounter barriers that hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange. Furthermore, dispersion promotes specialization within disciplines, as researchers focus deeply on narrow topics within their areas of expertise, further fragmenting knowledge into specialized subfields.\nIn the field of evolutionary thought, the dispersion of knowledge arises from a complex interplay of historical, interdisciplinary, and methodological factors, highlighting the diverse and multifaceted nature of evolutionary inquiry. Over time, evolutionary theory has given rise to various paradigms and theoretical frameworks, each reflecting different interpretations and emphases within the discipline. Interdisciplinary engagement has been central to this dispersion, intersecting with numerous fields such as biology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and economics. Each discipline approaches evolutionary phenomena from its unique perspective, leading to diverse interpretations and methodologies. Consequently, evolutionary insights become dispersed across disciplinary boundaries, reflecting the varied lenses through which scholars from different fields view evolutionary processes.\nThe broad applicability of evolutionary principles to diverse phenomena further contributes to this dispersion. From biological evolution to cultural dynamics and economic behavior, evolutionary concepts resonate across a wide array of domains, resulting in the dispersion of evolutionary insights across disparate fields of study. Methodological pluralism within evolutionary thought further amplifies this dispersion. Scholars employ a variety of empirical, qualitative, mathematical, computational, and comparative approaches to investigate evolutionary processes, each yielding unique insights and perspectives. These methodological preferences vary across disciplines and research traditions, creating a highly dispersed landscape of evolutionary inquiry."

    "section": "2.2 Knowledge Fragmentation",
    "text": "2.2 Knowledge Fragmentation\nKnowledge fragmentation involves the compartmentalization and isolation of information into distinct fragments or disciplines, each characterized by specific boundaries and specialized focus areas. Fragmentation creates disciplinary silos where researchers operate within narrow domains of expertise and research, often with limited interaction or collaboration across fields. These silos are upheld by disciplinary boundaries that define the scope of each field and restrict the flow of information and ideas between disciplines. As a result, researchers within fragmented fields may adopt reductionist approaches, simplifying complex phenomena to fit within their disciplinary frameworks.\nThe impact of knowledge fragmentation can be profound, creating barriers to the integration and synthesis of knowledge across disciplines. By reinforcing disciplinary boundaries, fragmentation impedes interdisciplinary collaboration and hampers efforts to develop comprehensive, holistic understandings of complex phenomena. Moreover, fragmentation can lead to a narrow perspective among researchers, who may become entrenched in their disciplinary viewpoints and methodologies, potentially overlooking valuable insights from other fields. This narrow focus can result in duplicated efforts as researchers within fragmented disciplines inadvertently replicate studies or fail to consider relevant findings from complementary fields, resulting in inefficiencies and redundancy.\nThe fragmentation of evolutionary thought into disciplinary silos and compartments is driven by a combination of historical, methodological, and institutional factors that continue to influence the field today. These factors have significantly shaped the evolution and structure of evolutionary studies. Despite efforts to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and integration, disciplinary boundaries persist, often reinforced by institutional structures, funding mechanisms, and academic incentives. These boundaries limit the exchange of ideas and hinder the development of comprehensive, holistic understandings of evolutionary processes. For example, evolutionary economics and evolutionary biology often operate in separate academic spheres, with economists focusing on market dynamics, innovation, and firm behavior, while biologists concentrate on genetic and ecological aspects of evolution. This separation is maintained by distinct funding sources, specialized journals, and academic departments, which can discourage collaboration and the sharing of insights between these disciplines. As a result, important connections between biological evolution and economic behaviors may be overlooked or underexplored, such as how evolutionary principles can inform the understanding of market adaptations and organizational strategies. Overcoming these challenges requires dedicated efforts to break down interdisciplinary barriers, encourage collaboration among scholars from different disciplines, and integrate diverse perspectives within the field of evolutionary thought."

    "section": "2.3 Knowledge Reductionism",
    "text": "2.3 Knowledge Reductionism\nReductionism involves dissecting complex phenomena into isolated components or subsystems, often at the expense of understanding the system as a whole and neglecting a holistic perspective. While this approach can yield valuable insights, it can also obscure the broader context and interconnections between different parts of a system. When scholars focus on isolated elements rather than the interactions and relationships among them, reductionism limits the scope of research and the potential for integrative theories and solutions.\nIn evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of the firm this reductionist tendency appears when scholars concentrate solely on specific aspects or subtopics without considering the interconnectedness and interdependencies within the broader evolutionary framework. For example, researchers might focus exclusively on technological innovation within firms, analyzing how specific advancements influence firm performance. While this focus is valuable, it may overlook the interactions between these innovations and other factors such as market conditions, regulatory environments, and organizational culture. Without considering these interactions, the analysis remains incomplete and potentially misses key insights into the firm’s overall evolutionary dynamics.\nThe risks associated with reductionist approaches are multifaceted. First, reductionism can result in a loss of context, where researchers fail to recognize the broader factors influencing economic evolution and firm behavior. By isolating specific components or mechanisms, scholars may overlook the environmental, social, and institutional dynamics that shape evolutionary processes within the economic landscape. Second, reductionism may fail to capture emergent properties inherent within complex economic systems. For instance, in evolutionary economics, interactions among diverse economic agents and institutions often give rise to emergent phenomena that cannot be understood by examining components in isolation. Failure to recognize and account for these emergent properties may lead to a limited understanding of economic evolution and dynamics.\nFurthermore, reductionism may impede the ability to effectively address complex problems. Many economic phenomena, including firm behavior and market dynamics, are inherently complex and multifaceted, requiring a holistic understanding to develop comprehensive solutions. Scholars using reductionist approaches often overlook the interconnections and interactions crucial for understanding complex systems, leading to incomplete or erroneous conclusions that fail to address the full scope of a problem. Ultimately, reductionist approaches that oversimplify these problems may result in inadequate policy prescriptions or managerial interventions that do not address their underlying complexity.\nReductionism can also impede interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge integration within evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of firms. Given the inherently interdisciplinary nature of these fields, effective research often necessitates integrating insights from diverse disciplines, including economics, biology, psychology, and sociology. Reductionist tendencies restrict researchers’ capacity to engage with broader interdisciplinary questions and inhibit the synthesis of knowledge across different domains. Consequently, this overspecialization may stifle the advancement of the discipline by limiting opportunities for innovation and the cross-fertilization of ideas."

    "text": "3.1 The Value of Meta-Frameworks\nMeta-frameworks prevent researchers from constantly “reinventing the wheel” with each new investigation. Instead, meta-frameworks facilitate advancements by allowing researchers to apply them to less explored areas or integrate them with novel knowledge from other disciplines. Meta-frameworks further empower researchers by contextualizing their work within a specific field, providing a robust collection of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms with demonstrated utility in that domain (Cox et al. 2016). This not only facilitates knowledge synthesis and focus on key concepts and their relationships, but also stimulates scholarly discourse, fosters collaborative and interdisciplinary research endeavors, and lays the groundwork for subsequent empirical studies and effective communication of advancements and discoveries.\nDespite their recent proliferation and wide-ranging applications across science, governance, and policy-making, concerns regarding meta-framework creation and use still persists. Critics argue that meta-frameworks can become “black boxes,” lacking transparency in concept selection and relationship establishment. However, meta-frameworks typically emerge from a foundation of prior knowledge and experience, combined with empirical synthesis processes that integrate existing knowledge with research findings to develop more comprehensive frameworks.\nAs with other qualitative analysis systems, it is true that following development, meta-frameworks require operationalization, presenting challenges for both creators and users. Strategies need to be devised for case selection, synthesis activities, and integration with real-world data. These challenges underscore the critical importance of transparent and systematic methodologies for meta-framework synthesis."

    "section": "3.2 Benefits of the Meta-Framework",
    "text": "3.2 Benefits of the Meta-Framework\nThe construction of a meta-framework on evolution is driven by its numerous potential benefits and contributions to the field. Firstly, a meta-framework, essentially a synthesis of existing frameworks, offers a robust methodological approach to address the dispersed nature of knowledge on the concept and process of firm evolution. By integrating insights from evolutionary economics, organizational theory, and related disciplines, our meta-framework establishes a unifying structure that bridges diverse research strands related to evolutionary firm behavior. This holistic perspective, which connects micro-level organizational dynamics with macro-level environmental influences, offers substantial advantages. A meta-framework serves as a valuable tool for both scholars and practitioners, enabling them to craft more effective strategies for managing organizational change, promoting innovation, and adapting to dynamic market conditions.\nSecondly, the meta-framework serves as a methodological bridge, linking theoretical concepts with empirical observations in the evolutionary analysis of firms. It offers a structured approach for organizing diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiries, providing researchers with a standardized vocabulary of core concepts and essential terms for building causal explanations. This systematic methodology promotes rigor and coherence in research, facilitating clearer interpretation of empirical findings and driving theoretical advancements in understanding firm behavior.\nThirdly, the meta-framework facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing a shared language and conceptual framework for scholars and practitioners across diverse disciplinary backgrounds. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, the meta-framework encourages the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers, fostering innovative insights and perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly important for addressing complex research questions that necessitate multifaceted analyses drawing from multiple knowledge domains.\nFourth, the step-by-step procedural approach used to construct the meta-framework ensures a high degree of transparency. This clarity enables a precise delineation of the systematic processes involved in data analysis, from descriptive exploration to explanatory inference. The transparency also extends to the researchers’ interpretive efforts, providing a clear and traceable progression of analytical insights in studies focused on evolution and the behavior of the firm.\nFifth, unlike other qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, constructing a meta-framework adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby accommodation to a wider range of data types and research contexts (Goldsmith 2021; Gale et al. 2013). Such flexibility is crucial for this investigation, as it relies primarily on secondary data from both conceptual and empirical studies on evolution across the natural and social sciences. By synthesizing insights from diverse disciplines, the meta-framework enables a comprehensive perspective that transcends traditional boundaries, fostering a deeper understanding of evolutionary dynamics within firms.\nIn conclusion, developing a meta-framework aligns with the research objectives of this study, providing a comprehensive and systematic approach to analyzing the evolutionary dynamics of firms. It fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, supports the advancement of theoretical frameworks, and significantly contributes to the progress of evolutionary economics.\n\n\n\n\nBinder, Claudia R, Jochen Hinkel, Pieter WG Bots, and Claudia Pahl-Wostl. 2013. “Comparison of Frameworks for Analyzing Social-Ecological Systems.” Ecology and Society 18 (4).\n\n\nCox, Michael, Sergio Villamayor-Tomas, Graham Epstein, Louisa Evans, Natalie C Ban, Forrest Fleischman, Mateja Nenadovic, and Gustavo Garcia-Lopez. 2016. “Synthesizing Theories of Natural Resource Management and Governance.” Global Environmental Change 39: 45–56.\n\n\nGale, Nicola K, Gemma Heath, Elaine Cameron, Sabina Rashid, and Sabi Redwood. 2013. “Using the Framework Method for the Analysis of Qualitative Data in Multi-Disciplinary Health Research.” BMC Medical Research Methodology 13 (1): 1–8.\n\n\nGoldsmith, Laurie J. 2021. “Using Framework Analysis in Applied Qualitative Research.” Qualitative Report 26 (6).\n\n\nMollinga, Peter P. 2008. “The Rational Organisation of Dissent: Boundary Concepts, Boundary Objects and Boundary Settings in the Interdisciplinary Study of Natural Resources Management.” ZEF working paper series.\n\n\nPartelow, Stefan. 2023. “What Is a Framework?

    "text": "4.1 Familiarization with Literature\nBefore delving into the detailed construction of the meta-framework, an exploratory review of the extant literature was conducted covering the fields of evolution in the natural sciences, evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm, and other related areas within the social sciences, including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science. The primary objective was to gather as many different and interdisciplinary perspectives as possible, identify knowledge gaps, grasp the current state of knowledge, and pinpoint the most pertinent theories, models, and existing related frameworks. By completing the familiarization step first, the meta-framework was built on a solid foundation of prior research, ensuring its alignment with established knowledge.\nDuring the familiarization phase, the focus was on developing a broad understanding of key evolutionary concepts and their applications, as well as identifying interdisciplinary connections and the complexity of the field, rather than conducting a comprehensive review of all available studies. To achieve this, the process involved a targeted search for high-quality articles from major peer-reviewed databases (WOS and Scopus), as well as books and conference proceedings, all in English and without time restrictions. The search used various combinations of the term “evolution” along with related keywords such as “social,” “economics,” “firm,” “thinking,” and “history.”\nWhile not exhaustive, this approach effectively identified key themes, recurring patterns, and emerging debates within the field of evolutionary studies. It enabled the mapping of the intellectual landscape and informed the development of the research questions and objectives. Additionally, it provided valuable insights into the diverse perspectives and frameworks that have shaped evolutionary thought over the past two centuries."

Additionally, the iterative nature of this process enabled the refinement of research questions and objectives as new insights emerged during the synthesis. This adaptability proved essential, as the discovery of new themes during the meta-framework synthesis often reshaped the initial research focus, ensuring alignment with the evolving understanding of the subject."

The process included the selection of a foundational or seminal work that comprehensively addressed the central ideas relevant to our research question. The selected work had to provide a robust theoretical and empirical basis for constructing a baseline meta-framework and serve as a reliable source for identifying the essential dimensions of evolution as a process. The seminal work chosen was from the field of evolutionary natural sciences, and the reasons were twofold. First, the work had a widespread recognition within the scientific community for its contributions to the understanding of natural evolution. Second, the work offered a valuable historical perspective on the trajectory of evolutionary thought, encompassing both mainstream and divergent ideas.\nAfter choosing the seminal work, a thorough review was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of its core arguments, methodologies, and conclusions. During this stage, the recurring themes, significant dimensions, and the relationships between the core themes were identified. This step was critical for capturing the structure of the ideas and their interconnectedness, forming the foundation of the a priori framework. The extracted information was then organized into thematic categories. These categories were carefully aligned with the research objectives and encompassed core themes that were directly relevant to the focus of the study, as well as peripheral themes that provided valuable context or supporting insights.\nAfter completing the categorization process, the a priori meta-framework was refined to better align its themes and relationships with the specific goals of the research. This approach ensured that the resulting a priori meta-framework was grounded in established knowledge and tailored to serve as a structured template for mapping and coding new data in subsequent stages of the meta-synthesis, thereby enhacing coherence and completeness throughout the process."

The first strand delved into the domain of evolutionary economics, with a particular focus on the analysis of firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. The second strand explored case studies that utilized evolutionary concepts and/or frameworks to investigate the dynamics of the firm. Each review employed a distinct search strategy to ensure methodological rigor and the identification of high-quality research. Both WOS and SCOPUS databases were targeted to maximize the rigor and quality of the search.\nThe first thematic review adopted a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant scholarship pertaining to the fundamental tenets and interconnected concepts that characterize the evolutionary view of the firm. To capture the broadest possible range of ideas and perspectives, the review employed broad search terms and an extensive time-frame. The second review focused on case studies that analyzed firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. This review encompassed articles that explicitly contained the term “evolution” and/or “evolutionary” in their titles and those that analyzed the behavior of the firm in an evolutionary way although they did not explicitly contained the term “evolution” or “evolutionary” in the title. To identify the latter, a qualitative research technique known as “pearl-growing” was employed. This technique metaphorically refers to the process of iteratively accumulating valuable “pearls” of information by expanding the search based on references, citations, or recommendations found in an initial set of identified sources. In our context, the “pearls” were found after the valuable insights gained from the references and citations included in the first systematic literature review."

First, a systematic data extraction process was undertaken that collected relevant information from the selected studies, including verbatim quotes and key findings supported by the study data. This allowed the capture of all information necessary to address the research questions, ultimately forming a robust empirical foundation for the construction of the meta-framework.\nAfter data extraction, all data were mapped and coded againts the a priori meta-framework established earlier. The process involved organizing the data in a meaningful manner to facilitate the identification of emerging patterns and relationships. Data coding was conducted thematically, adhering to the predefined themes identified within the a priori meta-framework, although the coding approach remained adaptable. Any relevant data that did not fit the themes of the a priori meta-framework were incorporated through an inductive approach. This allowed new themes and relationships to emerge from the data itself, ensuring the meta-analysis captured the full range of relevant information, even if it fell outside the a priori framework.\nTo enhance the rigor and efficiency of this process, qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti was employed. While Atlas.ti does not supplant the researcher’s critical role in data analysis and interpretation, it significantly bolsters the methodological rigor, efficiency, and overall quality of the research endeavor. Atlas.ti played a key role in streamlining data management and coding tasks while also facilitating visual analysis to identify patterns, themes, and relationships that might be less apparent through strictly textual methods."

A thorough review process was conducted to ensure the reliability and relevance of both the coding and the new themes emerging from it. This involved critical examination of the whole work, carefully evaluating each theme to ensure faithful representation of the data within or outside the scope of the a priori meta-framework. As a result, the initial a priori meta-framework was further refined and extended to achieve a more accurate reflection of the extracted data.\nNext, the relationships between the new themes and the a priori themes were reexamined to generate meaningful insights into how they interact and influence one another. This interpretation, grounded in both the empirical data and the original a priori meta-framework, led to a revised conceptual meta-framework that provides a coherent and comprehensive explanation of the evolutionary behavior of the firm.\nBy adhering to these systematic steps, a final meta-framework was formulated, characterized by both rigor and adaptability. The meta-framework offers valuable insights that contribute to our understanding of evolutionary firm behavior. The transparent, comprehensive, and empirically grounded approach employed in its development ensures the meta-framework’s robustness as a tool for advancing both theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of evolutionary firm analysis. Notably, the final meta-framework integrates the a priori themes with those newly identified during the systematic literature reviews.

Evolution serves as a foundational explanatory paradigm not only within the natural sciences but also in social-related disciplines. By examining these diverse fields, the familiarization process sought to uncover common principles, distinctive disciplinary perspectives, and opportunities for integrating evolutionary theories across various domains.\nSeveral key transdisciplinary trends emerged, including:\n\nEvolution as a Universal Framework: The application of evolutionary principles beyond biology, in fields like systems science and social evolution, suggests a growing recognition of evolution as a unifying framework for understanding change and complexity.\nIntegration of Genetics and Culture: Emerging literature highlights the interplay between genetic evolution and cultural evolution, emphasizing the co-evolutionary dynamics that shape human societies and behaviors.\nThe Role of Complexity and Systems Thinking: A significant trend involves leveraging evolutionary theories to study complex systems, such as ecosystems, economies, and artificial intelligence, revealing insights into emergent properties and adaptive strategies.\nFocus on Mechanisms of Change: Across disciplines, there is a shift towards understanding the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change, including innovation, cooperation, and adaptation in dynamic environments.\n\nThe familiarization process not only provided a panoramic view of evolutionary ideas but also laid the groundwork for selecting a knowledge baseline in the subsequent steps. The insights gained during this phase ensured that the chosen baseline would reflect the complexity, breadth, and depth of evolutionary frameworks across natural and social sciences, fostering a comprehensive and integrative analysis."

    "text": "5.3 Selecting a Knowledge Baseline\nUnlike traditional meta-framework synthesis approaches, which typically require extensive literature reviews, consultations, and deep topic expertise to develop an a priori framework, our approach focused on selecting a seminal work from the existing literature that thoroughly addressed the key concepts and relationships defining evolution in the natural sciences. This reference work provided a foundational knowledge base for elucidating our a priori framework, simplifying the subsequent coding and synthesis process while eliminating the need for extensive preparatory efforts.\nThe selected work was Peter J. Bowler’s seminal book, “Evolution: The History of an Idea” (2009), which examines the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding the development of economic systems. Bowler’s interdisciplinary perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic processes as evolving systems shaped by continuous change. His analysis provides valuable insights for evolutionary economics by uncovering the historical origins of evolutionary ideas and their relevance to economic analysis.\nBowler’s work is also relevant to our research for its exploration of the interplay between cultural, scientific, and anthropological factors in shaping evolutionary theories. In the book, the author traces the development of evolutionary thought from its origins in ancient Greece to its modern understanding, highlighting how societal beliefs and values influenced these concepts. His insights are particularly valuable for evolutionary economists, as it underscores the importance of understanding the cultural and ideological contexts in which economic systems emerge and evolve.\nThe author delves into the diverse contributions of key figures to evolutionary thought, examining the ideas and theories of prominent thinkers and highlighting their impact on the evolution of the field. Understanding this intellectual lineage enriches our a priori meta-framework by offering valuable insights into the historical foundations of contemporary economic theories and methodologies. Bowler’s analysis further emphasizes the diversity of perspectives within evolutionary thought, providing a wide array of ideas to inform the analysis of evolutionary economic systems.\nUltimately, Bowler’s book explores the controversies and debates surrounding the concept of evolution, highlighting the different interpretations and challenges to evolutionary theory throughout history. This aspect is particularly relevant for constructing our a priori meta-framework, as it emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of economic evolution. By examining historical debates over evolutionary theory, our a priori meta-framework gains a deeper appreciation for the contested nature of economic processes and the diverse array of factors that shape them. Bowler’s nuanced analysis encourages critical engagement with evolutionary concepts and methodologies, fostering a more robust and interdisciplinary approach to studying economic systems.\nIn conclusion, Bowler’s comprehensive treatise on evolution provides a robust foundation for understanding key themes in evolution and aggregate dimensions, serving as the baseline for elucidating our a priori meta-framework."

    "text": "5.4 Elucidating the A Priori Meta-Framework\nThe a priori framework is a preliminary conceptual structure developed before the main meta-synthesis process begins. It serves as a foundation for organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data in a systematic manner. The main components of the a priori meta-framework include:\n\nThemes: Broad, overarching concepts and categories that capture key aspects of evolutionary natural processes. Each theme and categories encapsulate essential aspects of evolutionary theory, illuminating the intricate mechanisms governing evolution and evolutionary behavior.\nRelationships: Connections or interactions between the identified themes, illustrating how they influence or depend on each other.\nGuiding Structure: A logical template or model that directs data mapping and coding during the synthesis process, ensuring coherence and alignment with the research objectives.\n\nBy providing a structured starting point, the a priori framework serves as a template for coding data extracted during the literature review in the later stages of this research.\nAQUI HAY QUE PONER UN RESUMEN DEL NUMERO DE THEMES Y RELACIONES POR CATEGORÍA\nThe resulting a priori meta-framework contains the following key themes and relationships (Fig. 1):\n\n\n\nFig1. The a priori meta-framework. Source: own elaboration based on Bowler (2009)\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Unit of analysis\nIn evolutionary systems, the unit of analysis represents the fundamental entity on which observations and analyses are centered. Historically, the focus has shifted over time, beginning with the organism—defined in biology as an individual living entity, such as a plant, animal, or microorganism, capable of independent existence and reproduction. Later, attention moved to populations, and with the advent of the modern synthesis, to genes.\nWhen determining the unit of analysis in an evolutionary system, it is essential to distinguish clearly between the organism and the population as the primary focus of study. The individual organism represents a single living entity, while the population consists of a group of organisms of the same species, occupying a defined geographic area and sharing genetic similarities. The organism serves as the fundamental building block of the population, with its traits, behaviors, and adaptations shaping the broader dynamics of the population. As outlined in Darwin’s theory, natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism, driving changes in the frequencies of traits within the population over time.\nThe choice of the unit of analysis significantly influences the scope and focus of evolutionary studies. Focusing on individual organisms provides detailed insights into microevolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. On the hand, analyzing populations allows for the exploration of macroevolutionary patterns and trends, including speciation and diversification, by examining collective dynamics and genetic variability within and between populations. In essence, while studying individual organisms sheds light on localized mechanisms of evolutionary change, focusing on populations offers a broader perspective on species evolution and adaptation over time. Together, both units of analysis are essential for comprehensively understanding the complexities of evolution within natural systems, as their interplay shapes the evolutionary trajectory of species.\n\n\n5.4.2 Origin\nThe formation of populations from individual organisms fundamentally shapes the evolutionary trajectory of natural systems, making the study of individual origins a cornerstone of evolutionary analysis. Exploring the origins of individual organisms allows researchers to address essential questions about the emergence, diversification, distribution, and persistence of life forms on Earth. This inquiry involves examining historical evidence to uncover the mechanisms behind the origination and divergence of new species from common ancestors. Building on this foundation, evolutionary analysis can transition to exploring the trend of increasing complexity and the underlying forces that drive this progression.\nThe concept of “origin” is closely related to that of “generation” and “development processes”. While the study of the “origin” focuses on the emergence of new entities in evolutionary systems, whether they are new individual organisms or entire species, “generation” refers to the processes by which life perpetuates itself over time through reproduction and inheritance, ensuring the continuity and variation necessary for evolution. Meanwhile, “developmental processes” involve the mechanisms that, beginning at the embryonic stage, shape the types of changes organisms can experience over time. Developmental processes guide how individual organisms grow, mature, and express their traits throughout their lifetimes. Together, these concepts address key mechanisms that shape the evolutionary trajectory of individuals and populations: how novel forms of life arise (origin), how they are perpetuated (generation), and how their traits are expressed and influence evolutionary potential (developmental processes).\n\n\n5.4.3 Evolutionary vs change processes\nEvolutionary processes encompass dynamic mechanisms that drive changes within populations across successive generations. Rather than acting solely on individual organisms, these mechanisms result in accumulated changes that are inherited within populations. Analyzing evolution at the population level reveals broad patterns of genetic variation, selection pressures, and speciation processes. Gene flow plays a crucial role by spreading advantageous traits and maintaining genetic diversity among populations. In contrast, isolation mechanisms, such as geographic or reproductive barriers, limit gene flow, fostering genetic differentiation and potentially leading to speciation. Natural selection operates on genetic variation, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction in specific environments. Meanwhile, genetic drift and mutation contribute additional layers of complexity, influencing population dynamics and shedding light on overarching evolutionary trends.\nChange processes occur within individual organisms, whether phenotypic, behavioral, or genetic, often in response to environmental pressures and internal dynamics. When changes occur, they contribute to the genetic variation within populations. Natural selection acts as a guiding force, favoring traits that enhance survival or reproductive success in specific ecological niches. This selective process, influenced by environmental factors, shapes an organism’s adaptation and survival chances. Over successive generations, advantageous traits become more common, while less beneficial traits fade.\nThe most comprehensive evolutionary approaches examine the interplay between individual-level changes and broader population-level processes. This integrated perspective clarifies how individual adaptations shape the overall evolutionary trajectory of species. By studying the relationship between individual-level changes and population dynamics, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving species evolution and adaptation in various ecological contexts.\n\n\n5.4.4 Environment\nThe environment plays a key role in shaping evolutionary processes, as it provides the backdrop for how populations and individuals interact and adapt. In natural systems, the environment consists of both biotic and abiotic factors that influence species distribution, behavior, and evolutionary paths. Biotic factors refer to interactions among living organisms, such as competition for resources, predation, and symbiotic relationships. Abiotic factors, in contrast, include non-living elements like climate, geography, and physical resources. Together, these factors create the dynamic complexity of ecosystems, driving species to continually adapt for survival and reproduction.\nIn addition to these factors, evolutionary processes are driven by exogenous and endogenous dynamic forces, each having varying intensities and directional impacts. Exogenous forces originate from external sources outside individual organisms or ecosystems, such as climate fluctuations, geological events, and rare phenomena like asteroid impacts. These external influences can significantly affect habitats, species distributions, and evolutionary trajectories by altering environmental conditions and triggering evolutionary responses. In contrast, endogenous forces emerge from within organisms or ecosystems, or through interactions among organisms. Endogenous forces include genetic mutations, physiological responses, and ecological interactions within populations, all of which shape genetic compositions and population structures over time.\nEnvironmental forces and factors are fundamental in shaping an organism’s fitness, guiding natural selection, and determining evolutionary pathways. These elements drive species to evolve traits and behaviors adapted to their specific environmental niches, enhancing their survival and reproductive success. Working in tandem, they play distinct yet complementary roles. Environmental factors provide the foundational conditions and contexts for life, such as climate, habitat, and biological interactions, while forces actively propel changes within these contexts. Together, they create a dynamic interplay that is central to understanding evolution. Grasping this relationship is critical for uncovering the mechanisms behind species adaptation, biodiversity patterns, and ecosystem resilience.\nThe environment is also shaped by its historical trajectory. Past events, such as environmental disturbances and climatic shifts, leave lasting marks on ecosystems, influencing species composition, habitat availability, and biodiversity. Ecosystems with long histories tend to have greater biodiversity and genetic resilience, while disturbances may leave legacies that constrain adaptation. Incorporating historical perspectives into evolutionary analysis provides key insights into path-dependent processes, which are crucial for designing effective conservation strategies that strengthen ecosystem resilience.\n\n\n5.4.5 Phenotypic traits\nThe structural and behavioral traits of individual organisms are central to the evolutionary dynamics of natural systems. Structural traits encompass physical characteristics such as morphology, anatomy, and physiology, which define an organism’s form and function. These traits play a critical role in enabling organisms to adapt to their environments and interact with other species. Behavioral traits, in contrast, involve the actions and responses of organisms within their environment, including activities like feeding, mating rituals, communication, and social interactions.\nThe interaction between structural and behavioral traits influences the ecological niche that organisms occupy and determines their fitness within a specific environment. Organisms with advantageous traits have a higher likelihood of survival and reproduction, passing these traits on to future generations. This process drives the emergence, modification, or loss of traits, shaping an organism’s adaptive strategy over time. By studying the morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of organisms, researchers can uncover valuable insights into species strategies, the dynamics of ecological communities, and the co-evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity through generations.\n\n\n5.4.6 Adaptation\nAdaptation is a fundamental driver of evolutionary change at the individual level within natural systems. Organisms continuously modify their traits, behaviors, and physiological processes in response to environmental pressures. At its core, adaptation enhances an organism’s fitness and survival within specific ecological niches. Through natural selection, individuals with traits that provide reproductive or survival advantages under prevailing conditions are more likely to pass on their genes. Over time, this process results in the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, improving their overall fitness and resilience to environmental challenges.\nAdaptation operates through various mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, genetic mutations, and behavioral changes. Phenotypic plasticity enables traits to adjust dynamically to environmental conditions, while mutations introduce new genetic variations. Behavioral adaptations improve resource utilization, predator avoidance, and reproductive success. Understanding adaptation at the individual level is key for uncovering the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change and species diversification. This knowledge can also illuminate how species develop adaptive strategies, the emergence of novel traits, and the evolving dynamics of ecological interactions over time.\n\n\n5.4.7 Heredity\nHeredity is the process through which genetic information is passed from one generation to the next, serving as a cornerstone of evolutionary processes. Encoded within DNA molecules, genetic material contains the instructions that guide an organism’s development, growth, and functioning. Heredity operates through the replication and transmission of genetic material during processes such as mitosis and meiosis. This transmission, combined with mechanisms like genetic mutations and recombination, creates variation in traits among individuals within a population. Such variation is crucial for understanding the mechanisms driving evolutionary change, as it shapes species’ diversity, adaptation, and persistence over time.\nHeredity is intrinsically linked to reproduction, which ensures the transfer of genetic information from parents to their offspring. This continuity of genetic traits across generations provides the foundation for evolutionary change. Mutations and genetic recombination during reproduction introduce diversity within populations, which fuels natural selection and facilitates adaptation to shifting environmental conditions. Exploring the interplay between heredity and reproduction is therefore essential for understanding how individual-level changes contribute to evolutionary dynamics, revealing the processes that drive species evolution and adaptation in natural systems.\n\n\n5.4.8 Reproduction\nReproduction is a fundamental process driving evolutionary dynamics at the individual level. Through the production of offspring, organisms perpetuate their genetic lineage and pass on hereditary traits, ensuring the continuity of life and preserving genetic diversity within populations. Both sexual and asexual reproduction contribute to this diversity, enriching the genetic pool and enhancing a population’s adaptability. Factors such as mate selection, mating behaviors, timing, and reproductive success significantly influence the reproductive process, shaping the genetic composition and evolutionary direction of species.\nModern evolutionary theory highlights reproductive success as the key driver of natural selection, emphasizing the importance of transmitting genetic information to future generations. This focus has spurred extensive research into sexual selection, reproductive mechanisms, and the role of geographic barriers in species diversification. Understanding these mechanisms is thus vital for unraveling the complexities of evolution in natural systems. However, this perspective is not without criticism. Stephen Jay Gould, for instance, argued against an overly narrow focus on reproductive success as the sole driver of evolutionary change (2002). Ultimately, exploring reproduction at the individual level provides valuable insights into the adaptive strategies species employ, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the evolutionary forces shaping populations over time.\n\n\n5.4.9 Variation\nIn evolutionary science, variation refers to the diversity of traits and characteristics within populations, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Variation provides the foundation for understanding phenotypic and genotypic differences within and among species. Variation is also central to competition and selection, as individuals possessing advantageous traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits to future generations. Over time, this differential reproductive success promotes the spread of favorable traits, driving evolutionary change.\nA key source of variation is mutation, which introduces new genetic variants into populations. While most mutations are neutral, others can produce significant phenotypic differences, potentially offering advantages or disadvantages. The environment plays a critical role in determining which mutated traits are favored and proliferate within a population. Evolutionary analysis must account for this interplay between genetic variation and environmental pressures to fully understand how traits evolve and populations adapt.\n\n\n5.4.10 Competition\nCompetition is a key driver of evolutionary dynamics within natural systems, arising when organisms compete for limited resources such as food, water, or territory. This pressure favors traits that provide a competitive advantage, leading to evolutionary changes and the inheritance of beneficial traits by subsequent generations. Within populations, competition takes various forms: direct competition for resources, interference competition involving aggressive interactions, and exploitative competition where one organism outcompetes another by more efficiently utilizing shared resources. These interactions often drive niche differentiation, where species adapt to partition resources, reducing direct competition and enabling coexistence within the same habitat.\nCompetition also fuels evolutionary innovation and adaptation, pushing species to develop traits and behaviors that provide a competitive edge. This process can lead to species diversification and the evolution of complex ecological relationships over time.\nUltimately, competition lays the foundation for natural selection, enabling the accumulation of adaptive traits while diminishing the prevalence of less advantageous ones. Understanding the dynamics of competition is critical for exploring species interactions, community dynamics, and evolutionary pathways in ecosystems. By examining these interactions, evolutionary analysts gain valuable insights into the forces shaping biodiversity, ecological resilience, and the stability of natural systems.\n\n\n5.4.11 Selection\nSelection mechanisms operate on the diversity of individual units, favoring traits that provide competitive advantages and enhance survival. Selection processes are fundamental drivers of evolutionary change. Among them, natural selection is a primary mechanism, favoring traits that increase an organism’s fitness and reproductive success in its environment. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing their genetic material to future generations. Over time, this differential reproductive success results in the accumulation of beneficial traits within populations, enabling adaptation to changing environmental conditions.\nHowever, although natural selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, selection operates through various mechanisms, including directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection. Directional selection shifts traits towards one extreme, stabilizing selection maintains the status quo within a population, and disruptive selection leads to divergence. Understanding these selection processes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and biodiversity within natural systems.\nSelection operates through multiple mechanisms, each influencing evolutionary trajectories differently:\n\nDirectional selection pushes traits toward one extreme, favoring a specific adaptation.\nStabilizing selection preserves the current state, maintaining traits that are already well-suited to the environment.\nDisruptive selection favors extreme traits at both ends of the spectrum, often leading to divergence within a population.\n\nEach type of selection represents a distinct pathway that drives population adaptation and evolution over time. Understanding these processes is therefore important for revealing how evolutionary change occurs and for explaining the development of biodiversity within natural systems."

    "section": "6.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method",
    "text": "6.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method\nThere are arguments about whether it is feasible or acceptable to conduct syntheses of qualitative evidence at all,41 and whether it is acceptable to synthesise qualitative studies derived from different traditions. The distinctions, tensions and conflicts between these have been vividly described.@dixon2005synthesising\nPerhaps even more likely to generate controversy are attempts to synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence. It is evident from the discussion above that synthesis of diverse forms of evidence will generally involve conversion of qualitative data into quantitative form or vice versa. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nShould reviews start with a well-defined question and how many papers are required? The issue of questions is an important one for syntheses. It will be clear that the methods described above will be more suited to some questions than others: for example questions concerning causality may be better suited to qualitative comparative analysis than questions concerned with the production of mid-range theory, which might be better suited to meta-ethnography. The issue of how questions should be identified and formulated in the first instance is one on which there is much uncertainty.\nEstabrooks et al, like many in the systematic review community, argue that review questions should be selected to focus on similar populations or themes.43 However, others point out that in primary qualitative research, definitions of the phenomenon emerge from the data.15 Whether one should start with an a priori definition of the phenomenon for purposes of a secondary synthesis is therefore an important question.@dixon2005synthesising\nA related issue is how to limit the number of papers included in the review. One approach is to narrow the focus. An alternative strategy is offered by theoretical sampling, used in primary qualitative research with a view towards the evolving development of the concepts. Sampling continues until theoretical saturation is reached, where no new relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category, either to extend or contradict it.45 It has been suggested that this approach would also be suitable for selecting papers for inclusion in reviews.46–48 However, the application of this form of sampling has been rarely tested empirically, and some express anxiety that this may result in the omission of relevant data, thus limiting the understanding of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nAppraising studies for inclusion The issue of how or whether to appraise qualitative papers for inclusion in a review has received a great deal of attention. The NHS CRD guidance emphasises the need for a structured approach to quality assessment for qualitative studies to be included in reviews, but also recognises the difficulties of achieving consensus on the criteria that might constitute quality standards.5 Some argue that weak papers should be excluded. Others, however, propose that papers should not be excluded for reasons of quality, particularly where this might result in synthesisers discounting important studies for the sake of ‘surface mistakes’, which are distinguished from fatal mistakes that invalidate the finding.Published examples include reviews that have chosen not to appraise the papers,14 as well as those which have opted to appraise the papers using a formalised approach.22 If the argument prevails that some quality appraisal is necessary, the problem then arises as to how this should be undertaken. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nConclusions There is an urgent need for rigorous methods for synthesising evidence of diverse types generated by diverse methodologies. These methods are required to meet the needs of policy-makers and practitioners, who need to be able to benefit from the range of evidence available. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)"

An evolutionary analyst is understood to be an academic or professional who has a clear and deep understanding of the evolutionary functioning of systems and who is capable of using rigorous analysis and tools to determine the factors that explain their essence and elements of change.\n\n\n6.5.2 Prediction ability\nIf we are able to acquire a deep understanding of the functioning of the evolutionary system, its components, behaviors and flow of changes, we can then better foresee in which direction the evolutionary system is moving and glimpse whether the system has the capacity to survive or, on the contrary, is doomed to disappearance.\nIt is worth considering the possibility of whether, based on increasingly deeper knowledge of the evolution of a system, it would be possible to act on the future of the system. In other words, if it could be feasible to design your own plan and carry it out based on the knowledge generated about the evolution of the system.\nTo what extent is the system under observation random in change or does it evidence a logic that can be known and even altered based on our desires or needs?\n\n\n6.5.3 Manipulation of the system and its programmability\nIf they were really able to manipulate the system as we wish, on what elements would it be most feasible to do so? Would it be possible to act on both the structural and behavioral elements, only on one of them? Being able to act on a known evolutionary system would open new and great opportunities to design systems that meet a wide diversity of needs.\nThe above would necessarily entail having to assess the ethical problems of altering the course of nature and the new problems that would emerge by distorting the natural mechanisms of the functioning of life and society. The opposite position would be to conclude that the system is unalterable and we cannot intelligently design it to satisfy our desires.\nSociety would go from a stage in which social systems are considered elusive to another in which we would be able to know to what extent their evolution is random, to what extent there is causality and to what extent they are programmable.\n\n\n6.5.4 Inform and activate policies\nAn evolutionary analysis framework can serve to inform who cannot support themselves, namely, who is more likely to survive and continue competitive, and who is threatened by disappearance.\nIdentifying who dominates over whom, that is, elucidating the relationships and power structures has great significance, but it is also a way to understand how species advance. In fact, the process of replacement or extinction of species is an essential aspect to understand human progress.\nThe level at which the analyst expects to inform policy, or the level of contribution expected by decision makers from an evolutionary model, is a factor in determining the level of analysis to be used in the “struggle for existence.”\nAdditionally, if education (education policies) could improve individuals, the benefits could perhaps be passed on through inheritance (this is a Lamarckian view).\n\n\n6.5.5 Overcoming the barriers that prevent systematic struggle\nFrom the RQs: Another question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual permits the struggle to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.\nThis leads us to the recommendation, in some circumstances mediated by policies, that the struggle does not have constraints that condition it. Thus, as the environment continues to pose challenges that must be faced (resolved) by the individual, progress will continues.\n\n\n6.5.6 Eugenics of individuals\nThe above leads us to the problem of eugenics, and the reflection on to what extent the system must ensure that the selection produces and there are no barriers for it to unfold its effects.\n\n\n6.5.7 The connection with complex systems\nThe analysis of evolutionary systems demonstrates a connection with complex systems, such that species should be seen as complex systems with an enormous amount of variation, stimulated by selection.\n\n\n6.5.8 The contribution of this review to policy\nThe key message from this systematic review is that interventions will not work unless public views about the value, safety, benefits and costs of walking and cycling are taken into account. This information will thus be of interest to parents and children, government policy-makers at the national and local level, schools, and research funding bodies. Policy-makers need to understand that perceived safety is a key influence on walking and cycling, but that environmental improvements and facilities can encourage a shift away from car culture.@brunton2006synthesis"

    "section": "6.6 Framework Thematic Discussion",
    "text": "6.6 Framework Thematic Discussion\n\n6.6.1 On Evolution\nWhen addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what the unit of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied. This is a discussion that has changed over time, having moved from the individual organism to what is currently considered a more correct approach, the gene. What the above means is that instead of prioritizing “adaptive fitness” in the analysis, today it seems more appropriate to focus on the reproductive success of the individual. This new perspective has given rise to the movement of ultra-Darwinism.\nThe analysis of evolutionary stratigraphy, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.\nThe geological law of superposition, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.\n\n6.6.1.1 Hierarchy\nThe idea of hierarchy involves something on top down to somethinge else.\nOnce the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the hierarchical structure of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Classification\nA classification or taxonomy is a procedure used to better understand the diversity (and variation) of organisms.\nWhen studying the evolution of a population, building a classification or taxonomy of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through.\nWith a classification or taxonomy the analyst can study the diversity of the units (species) based e.g. in their morphology, as well as the ecological relationships that exist between them.\nIn the history of evolution, three major frameworks for classifying species are usually proposed:\n\nChain of being (Bonnet) -&gt; it is a hierarchical chain of relationships\nThe rope of being (Rubinet)\nLineo taxonomy based on visible resemblances (with no hierarchy)\n\n\n\n6.6.1.3 Miscelaneous\nThe idea of the extent to which the history of “life” has been progressive but in an irregular way.\nThe idea of “emergent evolution” (Lloyd Morgan) which highlights the new high-level properties that appear as evolution reaches a certain level of complexity.\n\n\n\n6.6.2 On the Origin\nThe idea of the Origin is consubstantially associated with the idea of an end, since everything that begins must necessarily have an end.\nThe problem of origin is closed related to the problem of generation, thus the evolutionary analyst must elucidate whether the origin of the unit is spontaneous, preformationist, etc.\nAn alternative perspective to the problem of origin can be raised from biogenesis (life arising from non-living matter) and the “primordial soup” (Opsin), that is, the combination of elements that gives rise to the synthesis of compounds ” organic” after adding energy to the system (from lightning, UVA radiation, volcanic activity, etc.)\n\n\n6.6.3 On the Environment\n\n6.6.3.1 On the Forces\nWe do not know the forces (and their sources) that operate driving the process of change in the individuals of a population.\nApart from the forces that operate at the level of individuals, it is necessary to know what the transmission mechanisms are like from the environment to the individual, between individuals, and vice versa, from the individual to the environment.\nWhat is the materiality of the pressure for change exerted by an environmental force?\n\n\n6.6.3.2 On Selection\nOne of the most difficult questions that every evolutionary analyst must face is how the selection process imposed by the environment actually work, and to what extent different alternative selection approaches can help explain the evolutionary course of the system.\nWe refer to the selection process not as the blind application of a closed paradigm that we know a priori will provide an explanatory response to the evolution of any system, but rather the analyst evaluates to what degree alternative selection models can provide insight into our understanding of the evolution of the system. It is about better understanding how rival visions can have a place in our understanding of the evolutionary phenomena of the system, even in an open and simultaneous way.\n\n\n\n6.6.4 On the Unit\n\n6.6.4.1 On the Structure\n\n\n6.6.4.2 On the Behavior\nTo what extent is the system’s behavior governed by inherited instincts? And to what extent can the selection process alter instincts? Are instincts constraints to the development of behavior and the process of change, or are they not such constraints?\nWhat behavioral traits can be considered innate and which are constructed with the interaction with the natural and social environment? What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?\nPerhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.\nCan individual behavior be predicted? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.\nTo what extent can learning and technology affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?\nThe problem of hierarchy can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g. intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?\nIt is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to control genes and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)\n\n\n\n6.6.5 On Change\nWe know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the historical past as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.\nIf change does not leave any proof (of evolution), why don’t we seek indirect progress (i.e. the equivalent of fossils)?\nIt is necessary to know which components of the individual’s structure (or flows) the forces of the environment act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.\nAlso relevant is the question of how the development process of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.\nDoes the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any goal or objective? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual’s process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g. a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?\nIn the analysis of evolutionary dynamics, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.\nWhat are the change mechanisms used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:\n\nHybridization\nRecombination\netc.\n\nTo what extent is the timeline for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.\nSpeaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary “clock” of the system. The idea of the clock is to explain traits that evolve at a constant rate overtime, due to underlying molecular mechanisms. In other words, that would explain the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time.\nIt is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.\nA possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as punctuated equilibria”. According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis.\nThe evolutionary analyst should open to the notion of arrow of time, and the preferred direction or sequence of change. And if the change process is reversible vs irreversible (with higher entropy). In turn, this should lead the analyst to consider the predictability or unpredictability of evolution.\nIs the result of evolution the same system of a new one?\n\n\n6.6.6 On Heredity\nWhat are the limits of heredity (change)?\n\n\n\n\nBrunton, Ginny, Sandy Oliver, Kathryn Oliver, and Theo Lorenc. 2006. “A Synthesis of Research Addressing Children’s, Young People’s and Parents Views of Walking and Cycling for Transport.”\n\n\nDixon-Woods, Mary, Shona Agarwal, David Jones, Bridget Young, and Alex Sutton. 2005. “Synthesising Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence: A Review of Possible Methods.” Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 10 (1): 45–53.\n\n\nOliver, Sandy R, Rebecca W Rees, Lorna Clarke-Jones, Ruairidh Milne, Ann R Oakley, John Gabbay, Ken Stein, Phyll Buchanan, and Gill Gyte. 2008. “A Multidimensional Conceptual Framework for Analysing Public Involvement in Health Services Research.” Health Expectations 11 (1): 72–84.\n\n\nWaters, Lea, and Daniel Loton. 2019. “SEARCH: A Meta-Framework and Review of the Field of Positive Education.” International Journal of Applied Positive Psychology 4: 1–46."

    "text": "7.1 Natural Science as the Cornerstone of Evolutionary Inquiry\nThe study of evolution in the natural sciences serves as a foundational pillar for understanding evolutionary phenomena across various disciplines due to its fundamental principles and overarching explanatory power. Evolutionary theory, rooted in biology and natural selection, elucidates the mechanisms driving change and adaptation in living organisms over time. These principles extend beyond biology, providing insights into the dynamics of change, adaptation, and innovation in diverse systems, including social, economic, and cultural domains. By examining how species evolve and interact within their environments, evolutionary science offers valuable analogies and frameworks for understanding analogous processes in other disciplines. Consequently, evolutionary concepts serve as a unifying framework, facilitating interdisciplinary research and fostering a deeper understanding of complex phenomena across different fields. Thus, the study of evolution in the natural sciences not only enriches our understanding of biological systems but also provides valuable insights into the dynamics of change and adaptation in broader contexts."

    "text": "7.2 What is a Framework?\nAt a general level, in this paper a framework is understood as an abstraction: a type of mental and communicative construct to help build a coherent world view. A framework is not always visible to the user, but a framework for the use of indicators in a decision making context should be designed in a conscious, communicative process (15). Assmuth & Hildén (16) define frameworks as “the conceptual and procedural constructs that assimilate, process, and give meaning to information”. This definition highlights two dimensions to help frameworks do precisely this: 1) the ‘conceptual’ dimension that aims to capture the substance or essence of what is to be measured and elucidated (for example, frameworks to measure ‘sustainability’ organized in the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) domains), and 2) the ‘procedural’ or ‘operational’ dimension, which refers to more practical concerns – who needs to do what to collect, produce and report the required information? A third important dimension not highlighted by Assmuth and Hilden’s definition concerns the purpose of the information, what is termed hereon the ‘utilization’ function.

The meta-framework is not a general theory, nor a master framework to be adopted directly by agencies, but a classification and evaluation device. It should, above all, allow for a structuring of the empirical analysis of frameworks adopted by agencies in practice. Such analysis will review how the conceptual, operational and utilization functions of a case framework are performed, and how the most important criteria for each function are fulfilled.
