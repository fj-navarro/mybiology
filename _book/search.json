    "title": "EVOLUTIOSoc: A Meta-Framework for Complex Social Systems",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a data-driven, meta-framework to support evidence-based decisions for researchers and practitioners when designing, investigating and implementing social complex systems: the EVOLUTIOSoc framework.\nEVOLUTIOSoc was developed through a two-stage process.\nStage one comprised the thematic grouping of topics based on a seminal evolution history work. Stage two involved testing the framework and fine-tuning it with selected works in evolution, both from the field of biology and the social sciences.\nStage one comprised a large-scale bibliometric review and thematic grouping of topics based on natural language processing of over 18,403 positive psychology studies. \nStage two involved action-research with ten schools testing the practical validity of the wellbeing themes identified in stage one with educators.\nThe result of these two stages identified six overarching pathways to wellbeing that formed the SEARCH framework: 1) strengths, 2) emotional manage- ment, 3) attention and awareness, 4) relationships, 5) coping and 6) habits and goals.\nThe aim of this current review paper was to examine the existing educational and psychology literature for evidence ofwhether each SEARCH pathway has been found to successfully foster student wellbeing. Seventy five peer-reviewed studies (total student N= 35,888) were reviewed from North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\nResults demonstrate the value and applicability of the SEARCH framework. The comprehensive review conducted in this paper is then used to discuss current gaps in positive education research as well as present the utility of SEARCH as a framework to support positive education science and practice.\nThe review of views studies concludes that children’s, young people’s and parents’ views about what helps and hinders their walking and cycling involves the strong culture of car use, the fear and dislike of local environments, children as responsible transport users, and parental responsibility for their children. Brunton et al. (2006)\nThe CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA) first presents an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the art of ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence frameworks in order to clarify the nature of the next steps towards a European ICT Skills Meta-Framework, and its relationship to the proposed European Qualifications Framework (EQF). Then, recommendations based on the results of the analysis are presented.@de2006european\nA comprehensive overview of ICT frameworks has been produced, and a structured inventory of five particularly significant ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence frameworks is presented, in terms of a number of key attributes. Three specific frameworks, representing the national approaches in three large Member States, are analysed in some detail, and certain findings are evident, based on their mutual similarities and differences. The overall structural paradigm and an example comparable profile for each are examined. European Committee for Standardization (2006)\nA structured review of four significant ICT Practitioner Frameworks (the three major national frameworks in the EU and one from North America) was carried out and is presented, and Level Descriptors for the specification of ICT Practitioner competence are developed from the generic EQF descriptors. In addition, based on the comparisons of existing frameworks, broad Guidance is provided for appropriate and effective use and further development of such frameworks. European Committee for Standardization (2006)\nAn “Ideal Scenario” is presented, aiming to introduce the potential benefits of greater coherence at the European level, and options are shown for possible ways of moving towards that world. It is recognized that there is a need for stronger evidence of benefits in relation to the different uses of such frameworks, and a set of recommendations for progressing increased coherence are made, in relation to both ICT Practitioner competence Frameworks and ICT Qualifications of different types.@de2006european\nThe in-depth analysis of a range of evidence leads to the following conclusions: - It is recommended to encourage and strengthen the process of convergence of ICT Practitioner skills/competence frameworks within the EU by means of a three step process:European Committee for Standardization (2006)\nKeywords: Evolutionary analysis, meta-systhesis, framework, complex systems, social science\n\n\n\n\nBrunton, Ginny, Sandy Oliver, Kathryn Oliver, and Theo Lorenc. 2006. “A Synthesis of Research Addressing Children’s, Young People’s and Parents Views of Walking and Cycling for Transport.”\n\n\nEuropean Committee for Standardization. 2006. “European ICT Skills Meta-Framework -State-of-the-Art Review, Clarification of the Realities, and Recommendations for Next Steps.” In Workshop Agreement, CWA.

    "section": "1.1 History",
    "text": "1.1 History\nThe concept of evolution, in the sense of a gradual development or change over time, has been a subject of contemplation and inquiry for civilizations throughout history. While ancient civilizations may not have had access to the scientific methods and knowledge that underpin modern evolutionary theory, they did observe and speculate about patterns of change in the natural world. For example:\n\nAncient Greece: The ancient Greek philosophers contemplated the origins and development of life, the diversity of species, and the process of change in the natural world, proposing early ideas that laid the groundwork for later theories of evolution. The pre-Socratic philosofer Anaximander proposed a theory of evolution where life originated from a primordial substance, the “apeiron”, which evolved over time through a process of spontaneous generation and transformation. He speculated that simpler forms of life gave rise to more complex organisms, anticipating the idea of a progression or development of species. Almost one hundred years later, Empedocles in his Theory of the Four Elements proposed that all matter was composed of four fundamental elements - earth, air, fire, and water. He suggested that living organisms arose from combinations of these elements, hinting at a process of transformation and change over time.\nAristotle (384 – 322 BCE): Aristotle proposed a scala naturae (Great Chain of Being), which depicted a hierarchical order of existence with all living beings arranged in a graded scale from simple to complex. While not a theory of biological evolution, Aristotle’s ideas influenced later thinkers and shaped medieval and early modern views of nature. Atomist philosophers such as Leucippus and his student Democritus proposed a materialistic view of the universe, suggesting that all phenomena could be explained in terms of interactions between atoms. While their ideas differed from modern evolutionary theory, their emphasis on naturalistic explanations contributed to humanity’s ongoing quest to understand the origins and development of life on Earth, and opened the possibility of variation and change in living organisms.\nAncient India and China: Ancient Indian and Chinese philosophies also explored ideas related to the origins and development of life. For instance, Hindu and Buddhist cosmologies include concepts of cyclical time and reincarnation, which imply a process of change and evolution, and they are early attempts to understand the natural world and humanity’s place within it. While not explicitly addressing biological evolution, Daoist texts such as the “Zhuangzi” and the “Dao De Jing” contained passages that reflected a cyclical view of time and the continuous transformation of the natural world. Central to the Chinese cosmology is the Yin-yang theory, which posited the dynamic interplay between opposing forces. This concept of balance and change informed Chinese views of the natural world, including notions of growth, decay, and cyclical renewal. While early Buddhist texts did not discuss biological evolution, the idea of continual change and the cycle of birth and rebirth suggested a broader understanding of evolutionary processes. Hindu cosmology, as outlined in texts such as the “Puranas” and the “Bhagavad Gita,” described cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth spanning vast epochs of time. The concept of “yugas” or cosmic ages implied a process of change and evolution within the universe.\nIslamic Golden Age: During the Islamic Golden Age, scholars like Al-Jahiz in the 9th century proposed a rudimentary form of natural selection in his work “Kitab al-Hayawan” (Book of Animals), where he speculated about how organisms compete for resources and adapt to their environments, suggesting that those best suited to their surroundings are more likely to survive and reproduce. Muslim philosophers such as Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna (Ibn Sina), and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) engaged in philosophical speculation and inquiry, drawing upon Greek, Persian, and Indian sources. They explored concepts such as the eternity of the universe, the nature of causality, and the possibility of spontaneous generation. Islamic scholars, including physicians, astronomers, and natural philosophers, observed and studied the natural world, including plants, animals, and celestial phenomena. While their inquiries focused primarily on practical and empirical aspects of nature, they contributed to a broader understanding of the diversity and complexity of life.\nIndigenous Cultures: Indigenous cultures around the world often developed rich and diverse cosmologies, creation myths, and oral traditions that reflected their understanding of the origins and development of life, and about the diversity of species. These stories usually include elements of change, adaptation, and transformation over time, and offer unique insights into humanity’s relationship with the natural world. Many indigenous cultures viewed time as cyclical rather than linear, with recurring patterns of creation, destruction, and renewal. This cyclical perspective encompasses the idea of continual change and transformation in the natural world, including the evolution of species over time. Some indigenous cultures have interpreted fossils, geological formations, and natural phenomena in ways that reflect their cosmological beliefs and spiritual worldviews. These interpretations differ from Western scientific explanations but provide cultural perspectives on the history and diversity of life on Earth.\n\nWhile these historical perspectives on evolution greatly differ from modern scientific understanding, they reflect humanity’s curiosity and attempts to make sense of the natural world and its processes of change. The development of modern evolutionary theory represents a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry, observation, and experimentation, building upon and refining earlier ideas and insights.\nIn the centuries preceding Charles Darwin’s formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection, several thinkers proposed ideas and concepts that contributed to the development of evolutionary thought. Some of the main thinkers of evolution in pre-Darwinian times include:\n\nLucretius (c. 99 – c. 55 BCE): A Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius wrote “De Rerum Natura” (On the Nature of Things), in which he espoused a form of atomism and proposed ideas about the origins and development of life through natural processes.\nGeorges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707 – 1788): Buffon, a French naturalist, proposed theories of transmutation and transformation of species in his work “Histoire Naturelle” (Natural History). He suggested that environmental influences could lead to changes in organisms over time.\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 – 1829): Lamarck, a French naturalist, proposed a theory of evolution based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He suggested that organisms could change over time in response to environmental pressures, and these acquired traits could be passed on to offspring.\nErasmus Darwin (1731 – 1802): Erasmus Darwin, an English physician, naturalist, and grandfather of Charles Darwin, proposed evolutionary ideas in his work “Zoonomia” and other writings. He suggested that life evolved from simpler to more complex forms through a process of gradual transformation.\n\nThese thinkers and others contributed to the development of evolutionary thought in pre-Darwinian times, laying the groundwork for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection in the 19th century. While their ideas differed from modern evolutionary theory, they reflected early attempts to understand the origins and development of life on Earth.\nIn the centuries preceding the formulation of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, various ideas and concepts about the origins and development of life were proposed by philosophers, theologians, and naturalists. These pre-Darwinian ideas laid the groundwork for later evolutionary theories. Some of the main ideas about evolution in pre-Darwinian times include:\n\nGreat Chain of Being: The concept of the Great Chain of Being, prevalent in ancient Greek, Roman, and medieval Christian thought, posited a hierarchical order of existence, with God at the pinnacle and all living beings arranged in a graded scale from simple to complex. While not a theory of biological evolution, it implied a continuum of life forms and the potential for change over time within a fixed, predetermined framework.\nTransformational Theories: Some ancient philosophers, such as Empedocles and Anaximander, proposed ideas of transformation and change in the natural world, suggesting that living organisms arose from combinations of fundamental elements or evolved from simpler forms over time.\nVitalism: Vitalism, a prominent idea in the medieval and early modern periods, proposed that living organisms possessed a vital force or essence that distinguished them from inanimate matter. While not explicitly evolutionary, vitalistic concepts contributed to debates about the nature of life and its origins.\nSpontaneous Generation: Spontaneous generation, the belief that living organisms could arise from non-living matter under certain conditions, was a widespread idea in antiquity and the Middle Ages. This notion suggested a form of continuous generation and transformation of life forms but did not imply a process of biological evolution as understood today.\nTransmutation of Species: Some naturalists in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, proposed theories of transmutation or transformation of species. Lamarck’s theory, for example, suggested that organisms could change over time in response to environmental pressures and that acquired traits could be passed on to offspring.\n\nOverall, these pre-Darwinian ideas about evolution reflected early attempts to understand the diversity and complexity of life on Earth. While they did not constitute a comprehensive theory of biological evolution, they contributed to the intellectual foundations upon which Darwin later built his groundbreaking theory of natural selection."

    "text": "1.3 The Need for a Meta-Framework in the Social Sciences\nSuccessfully building well-being in students is not simply a matter of delivering a one-off positive education intervention. Rather, an embedded approach across interconnected systems throughout a whole school is needed (Waters 2011; White and Murray 2015). A meta-framework can give researchers and practitioners a purposeful direction within which to design, apply and evaluate interventions. Such a framework must have broad and generalizable parameters that reflect a comprehensive model of student well-being, while still offering the flexibility needed to choose and/or design interventions that are best suited for different contexts.@waters2019search (…)In addition to its higher-order comprehensive nature, if a meta-framework is going to be useful in advancing positive education it must be evidence-based and actionable. Thankfully, the field has amassed a decent preliminary evidence base on effectiveness to draw upon (see Waters 2017, for a recent review of the field) Waters and Loton (2019) (…)Resultantly, a meta-framework must be useful in supporting the decision making of educators and practitioners applying positive education knowledge and interventions in concrete ways with students. Consistent with leading thinkers in the field who assert that wellbeing is a multidimensional construct, and that students need to have the opportunity to develop a diverse range of skills to build wellbeing (Diener et al. 1999; Forgeard et al. 2011; Keyes and Annas 2009), a meta-framework must be multidimensional.@waters2019search (…)Currently, the majority of frameworks in positive education are not multidimensional but, rather, focus on only one or two aspects of wellbeing. For example,(…) Waters and Loton (2019)"

    "text": "1.4 Research question\nOne of the key questions that an evolutionary analyst can try to answer is what are the mechanisms that explain or direct the escalator of progress, whether this is the “struggle for existence” between individuals, nations, races, etc.\nAnother question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual permits the struggle to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.\nResearch questions This review seeks to answer two questions: What research has been undertaken about the public’s views of walking and cycling as modes of transport? How do children’s, young people’s and parents’ views of the barriers to, and facilitators of, walking and cycling match interventions evaluated for their effects on walking and cycling?\n(From Methodology)The review was conducted in three parts. First, we searched for and mapped the existing research literature on the general public’s views of walking and cycling. Second, we conducted an in-depth review of a subset of this literature, the scope of which was selected by our Advisory Group, focusing on the views of children, young people and parents. Third, we synthesised the findings relating to these ‘views studies’ together with the research on interventions carried out by Ogilvie et al. (2004). The overall conclusions of the review are thus based both on international evaluations of specific interventions, and from findings of recent ‘qualitative’ research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) examining the views and experiences of children, young people and parents.@brunton2006synthesis\n1 Scope The scope issues in this workshop are very important, but they relate, rather than just to the types of skills considered, to the clarification and positioning of precisely what the proposed ICT Skills Meta-Framework is (and what it is not)European Committee for Standardization (2006)\nThe design of frameworks arises first and foremost from the intended purpose, or application. This is fundamental, since – although frameworks designed for one purpose can be, and often are, used for purposes beyond those they were designed for, they may well not be particularly well-suited for the other applications, and so may not perform effectively in that context. In short, frameworks – once created - can “take on a life of their own”, and this can often produce unexpected, and sometimes undesirable, effects in other contexts.@de2006european\nIn short, the main priority of an ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence Framework (and any European Meta-Framework related to such frameworks) is to provide something largely specified by employers, and of real value to them as well as to those employed as - and those seeking work as - ICT Practitioners, as well as stakeholders associated with both sides of the labour market.

A framework is not always visible to the user, but a framework for the use of indicators in a decision making context should be designed in a conscious, communicative process (15). Assmuth & Hildén (16) define frameworks as “the conceptual and procedural constructs that assimilate, process, and give meaning to information”. This definition highlights two dimensions to help frameworks do precisely this: 1) the ‘conceptual’ dimension that aims to capture the substance or essence of what is to be measured and elucidated (for example, frameworks to measure ‘sustainability’ organized in the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) domains), and 2) the ‘procedural’ or ‘operational’ dimension, which refers to more practical concerns – who needs to do what to collect, produce and report the required information? A third important dimension not highlighted by Assmuth and Hilden’s definition concerns the purpose of the information, what is termed hereon the ‘utilization’ function.

    "section": "3.1 What is a Framework?",
    "text": "3.1 What is a Framework?\nThere is no universal definition of a framework, but it is useful to provide a brief overview of different definitions for orientation. The Cambridge Dictionary states that frameworks are “a supporting structure around which something can be built; a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide something.”(…) Binder et al., (2013, 1) state that frameworks are useful for developing “a common language, to structure research on SES, and to provide guidance toward a more sustainable development of SES.”(…) Pulver et al., (2018, 1) suggest that frameworks “assist scholars and practitioners to analyze the complex, nonlinear interdependencies that character- ize interactions between biophysical and social arenas and to navigate the new epistemological, ontological, analyti- cal, and practical horizons of integrating knowledge for sustainability solutions.” Partelow (2023)\nIt is important to recognize that the above claims often suggest the dualistic or bridging positions held by frameworks, in both theory building and for guiding empirical observations. However, there is relatively little discussion in the above literature on how frameworks act as bridging tools within a theory of science or how frameworks add value as positioning tools in a field. Partelow (2023)\nAs positioning tools, frameworks seem to “populate the scientist’s world with a set of conceptual objects and (non-causal) relationships among them,” shaping (and sometimes limiting) the way we think about problems and potential solutions (Cox et al. 2016, 47). Thus, using a specific framework helps in part to position the work of a researcher in a field and its related concepts, theories and paradigms Partelow (2023)\nFrameworks are important research tools across nearly all fields of science. They are critically important for structuring empirical inquiry and theoretical development in the environmental social sciences, governance research and practice, the sustainability sciences and fields of social-ecological systems research in tangent with the associated disciplines of those fields Partelow (2023)\nMany well-established frameworks are regularly applied to collect new data or to structure entire research programs such as the Ecosystem Services (ES) framework …(…) Frameworks are also put forth by major scientific organizing bodies to steer scientific and policy agendas at regional and global levels such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Partelow (2023)\nthe role of frameworks as integral but often vague scientific tools, highlighting benefits and critiques. While frameworks can be useful for synthesizing and communicat- ing core concepts in a field, they often lack transparency in how they were developed and how they can be applied (…) This article provides a meta-framework for visualizing and engaging the four mediating processes for framework development and application: (1) empirical generalization, (2) theoretical fitting, (3) application, and (4) hypothesizing Partelow (2023)\nDespite the countless frameworks, it is not always clear how a framework can be developed or applied (Ban and Cox 2017; Partelow 2018; Nagel and Partelow 2022). Develop- ment may occur through empirically backed synthesis or by scholars based on their own knowledge, values, or interests. These diverse development pathways do, however, result in common trends. Partelow (2023)\nThe structure of most frameworks is the identification of a set of concepts and their general relation- ships — often in the form box-and-arrow diagrams — that are loosely defined or unspecified. This hallmark has both benefits and challenges. On one hand, this is arguably the purpose of frameworks, to structure the basic ideas of theory or conceptual thinking, and if they were more detailed they would be models. On the other hand, there is often a “black box” nature to frameworks. It is often unclear why some sets of concepts and relationships are chosen for integration into frameworks, and others not. Partelow (2023)\nNow shifting focus to how frameworks are applied. Some frameworks provide measureable indicators as the key variables in the framework, but many only suggest general concepts. This creates the need to link concepts and their relationships to data through other more tangible indicators (…) These methodologi- cal and study design steps necessary to associate data to framework concepts is often referred to as “operational- izing” a framework. However, without guidance on how to do this, scholars are often left with developing their own strategies, which can lead to heterogeneous and idiosyn- cratic methods and data.(…) This is not necessarily a problem if the purpose of a framework is to only guide the analysis of individual cases or synthesis activities in isolation, for example to inform local manage- ment, but it hinders meta-analyses, cross-case learning and data interpretability for others Partelow (2023)\nFrom the conceptually broadest to the most empirically specific, we can identify the following levels of theory: paradigms, frameworks, specific theories, models/ archetypes and cases (Table 1).(…) (whereby Frameworks:) Organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected of a theory. Partelow (2023)\nThere is a need to connect cases, models and specific theory up to the overall paradigms of a field to make aggregate knowledge gains. Here, the role of frame- works becomes more clear, as bridging tools that enable connections between levels of knowledge. From the top down, frameworks can specify paradigms with more tangible conceptual features and relationships, which can then guide empirical inquiry Partelow (2023)\nFurthermore, frameworks can also emerge from the bottom up, by distilling empirical data across cases and thus creating a knowledge bridge of more specified conceptual features and relationships that connect to a paradigm. In both top-down and bottom-up mechanism, frameworks can play a vital role in synthesizing and communicating ideas among scholars in a field — from empirical data to a paradigm. A challenge may be, how- ever, that multiple frameworks have emerged attempting to specify the core conceptual features and relationships in a paradigm. A mature scientific field is likely to have many frameworks to guide research and debate. There is, however, a lack of research and tools available to com- pare frameworks and their added value Partelow (2023)\nBeyond their use as positioning tools, frameworks make day-to-day science easier. They can guide researchers in designing new empirical research by indicating which core concepts and relationships are of interest to be meas- ured and compared.Scientific fields also need common fires to huddle around, meaning that we need reference points to initiate scholarly debates, coordinate disparate empirical efforts and to communicate findings and novel advancements through a common language. As such, frameworks are useful for synthesis research, focusing the attention of reviews and meta-analyses around core sets of concepts and relationships. Partelow (2023)\nThere is, however, a tension between frameworks that aim to capture complexity and those that aim to simplify core principles. Complexity oriented frameworks often advance systems thinking at the risk of including too many variables. They often have long lists of variables which makes empirical orientation and synthesis difficult. On the other hand, simplification frameworks face the challenge of leaving important things out, with the benefit of clarifying what may be important and giving clear direction Partelow (2023)\nThere has undoubtedly been a rise in the number of frameworks, but as expressed by Ban and Cox (2017, 2), “it is not clear what the role of a scien- tific framework should be, and relatedly, what makes for a successful scientific framework. Although there are many frameworks […] there is little discussion on what their scientific role ought to be, other than providing a common scientific language.”Partelow (2023)\n(ver el meta-framework que proponen los autores) In the center, frameworks provide two core bridging values: knowledge synthesis and knowledge communication. Three modes of logical reasoning contribute to framework development: induction, deduction and abduction. Frameworks are used and developed through four mediating processes: (1) empirical generalization, (2) theoretical fitting, (3) application, and (4) hypothesizing Partelow (2023)\n(esta explicación aunque se refiere al meta-framwork que ellos proponen lo puedo utilizar para justiciar el mío) The meta-framework can further help identify the posi- tioning of framework such as the type of logical reason- ing processes used to create it, as well as help clarify the role of a framework along the scale of knowledge production (i.e., from data to paradigm). It might be clear, for example, what paradigm or specific theory a framework contributes to. The meta-framework can add value by guiding the assessment of how frameworks fit into the bigger picture of knowledge contribution in their field. Furthermore, many scholars and practitioners are interested in developing new frameworks. The meta- framework outlines the mechanisms that can be considered in creating the framework as well as help developers of new frameworks communicate how their frameworks add value. For example, to link empirical data collection to theoretical work in their field. The meta-framework can help compare frameworks, to assess strengths and weaknesses in terms of their positioning and knowledge production mechanisms. It can also help elucidate the need for, or value of, new frameworks. This challenge is noted by Cumming (2014, 18) in the field of social-ecological systems, reflect- ing that “the tendency of researchers to develop “new” frameworks without fully explaining how they relate to other existing frameworks and what new elements they bring to the problem is another obvious reason for the lack of a single dominant, unifying framework.” Partelow (2023)\nHowever, reflection on the role and purpose of the frameworks we use needs to be a more common practice in science. The proposed meta-framework aims to showcase the role of frameworks as boundary objects that connect ideas and concepts to data in constructive and actionable ways, enabling knowledge to be built up and aggregated within scientific fields through using common languages and concepts (Mollinga 2008; Klein 1996).@partelow2023framework\nBoundary objects such as frameworks can be especially important for inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration, where there may be few prior shared points of conceptual understanding or terminology beyond a problem context. Mollinga (2008, 33) reflects that “frameworks are typical examples of boundary objects, building con- nections between the worlds of science and that of policy, and between different knowledge domains,” and that “the development of frameworks is at present probably the most common strategy in the field of natural resources management to achieve integration and interdisciplinar- ity,” (Mollinga, 2008, 31). (…) translating often esoteric academic concepts and findings into digestible and often visual objects.(…) Partelow et al., (2019) and Gurney et al., (2019) both use Ostrom’s SESF (Box 2) as a boundary object at the science-society interface to visually communicate systems thinking and social-ecological interactions to fishers and coastal stakeholders involved in local management decision-making. Partelow (2023)\nA framework can only be an effective boundary object if it catalyzes deliberation and scholarly debate — thus contestation over what it is and its value is seeded into the toolbox and identity of a scholarly field. Although most frameworks are likely to have shortcomings, flaws or controversial features, the fact that they motivate engagement around common problems and stimulate scholarly engagement is a value of its own. In doing so, frameworks often become symbols of individual and community identity in contested spaces.(…) Citing a framework both communicates the general purpose of what a scholar is attempting to achieve to others, and orients science towards a common synthetic object for future knowledge synthesis and debate Partelow (2023)\nFrameworks can act as tools for bridging disciplines, helping to catalyze interdisciplinary engagement (Mollinga 2008; Klein 1996). As many scientific communities shift focus towards solving real- world problems (e.g., climate change, gender equality), tools that can help scientists’ cooperate and communicate, such as a framework, will continue to play a vital role in achieving knowledge co-production goals. Partelow (2023)\nFrameworks have gained substantial popularity for the communication and synthesis of academic ideas, and as tools we all have the ability to create and perhaps the responsibility to steward. However, frameworks have struggled to find roots in a theory of science which grounds their contributions in relation to other scientific tools such as models, specific theories and empirical data.\n(OJO, a tener en cuenta!)

    "text": "3.2 Reasons to Choose Framework Analysis\nWe independently chose the framework approach to underpin data analysis for a range of reasons. First, the framework approach is particularly suited to the analysis of cross-sectional descriptive data enabling different aspects of the phenomena under investigation to be captured (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). Second, one of the advantages of the framework approach is that researchers’ interpretations of participants’ experiences are transparent (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). Third, for novice researchers moving from data management to developing the analysis sufficiently to answer the research questions posed can be a daunting and bewildering task. The interconnected stages within the framework approach explicitly describe the processes that guide the systematic analysis of data from the development of descriptive to explanatory accounts. Smith and Firth (2011)\nThe authors chose the framework synthesis approach because a published model was identified from the literature that conceptualised attitudes of adult women to the taking of vitamins and minerals [16]. The approach therefore was augmentative and deductive (building on this existing model or framework), rather than grounded or inductive (starting with a completely blank sheet).(…) The model identified did not entirely match the topic under study, but it was a “best-fit” and provided a relevant pre-existing framework and themes against which to map and code the data from the studies identified for this review. A list of themes was derived from this model (see Figure 1) and provided the a priori framework of themes against which to code the data extracted from the included studies.

    "text": "3.3 Characteristics\nIn epistemological terms, if we consider at two ends of the spectrum, one a highly constructivist vision of knowledge, and at the other, an unproblematized vision of knowledge as an “objective window open to the world,” the framework synthesis, although still implies a certain interpretation of the data, shares the attributes of critical realism where knowledge of reality is mediated by our perceptions and beliefs. Furthermore, its synthesis results are reproducible and correspond to a shareable objective reality.\nRegarding the extent of iteration during the review process, framework analysis involves an iterative process of searching the literature.\nAssessing quality is a key component in the review process of framework analysis. Typically, when performing a framework analysis, quality criteria are set for the selection of literature. Those studies that do not meet a certain number of the criteria are excluded.\nFramework analysis focuses on describing and summarising their primary data (often in a highly structured and detailed way) and translating the studies into one another. However, it also seeks to push beyond the original data to a fresh interpretation of the phenomena under review.\nWith regards of the synthetic product, namely, what is the synthesis for? It is clear that framework analysis views itself as producing an output that is directly applicable to policy makers and designers of interventions. There are a few framework synthesis which involved policy makers and practitioners in directing the focus of the synthesis and used the themes derived from the synthesis to infer what kind of interventions might be most effective in encouraging walking and cycling. Likewise, the products of the thematic synthesis took the form of practical recommendations for interventions (e.g. „do not promote fruit and vegetables in the same way in the same intervention‟).\nThere are a number of approaches to qualitative data analysis, including those that pay close attention to language and how it is being used in social interaction such as discourse analysis [15] and ethnomethodology [16]; those that are concerned with experience, meaning and language such as phenomenology [17,18] and narrative methods [19]; and those that seek to develop theory derived from data through a set of procedures and interconnected stages such as Grounded Theory [20,21]. Many of these approaches are associated with specific disciplines and are underpinned by philosophical ideas which shape the process of analysis [22]. The Framework Method, however, is not aligned with a particular epistemological, philosophical, or theoretical approach. Rather it is a flexible tool that can be adapted for use with many qualitative approaches that aim to generate themes. gale2013using\nFramework analysis operates from a pragmatic epistemology and can be applied to a variety of types of data and be employed for a variety of reasons (King & Brooks, 2018; Spencer, Ritchie, Ormston, et al., 2014). Data types used in framework analysis have included in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, observational data, policy documents, online discussion board posts, photographs, and case studies (Johnston et al., 2014; Mason et al., 2018; Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Roberts, 2000; Robertshaw & Cross, 2019; Struik & Baskerville, 2014; Tallentire et al., 2015; Tishelman et al., 2016). Approaches to framework analysis in applied research have varied from highly deductive analysis of fairly structured data (Pope et al., 2000) to inductively-oriented theory-building work for knowledge users, such as policy makers and health care providers (e.g., Goldsmith et al., 2017; Swallow et al., 2011).@goldsmith2021using\nGlossary of key terms used in the Framework Method Gale et al. (2013) Analytical framework: A set of codes organised into categories that have been jointly developed by researchers involved in analysis that can be used to manage and organise the data. The framework creates a new structure for the data (rather than the full original accounts given by participants) that is helpful to summarize/reduce the data in a way that can support answering the research questions"

    "text": "3.4 Key steps of meta-framework\nit is worth taking a step back to consider briefly what needs to happen before analysis begins. The selection of analysis method should have been considered at the proposal stage of the research and should fit with the research questions and overall aims of the study (…) At this early stage it is also useful to consider whether the team will use Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), which can assist with data management and analysis. Gale et al. (2013)\nAs any form of qualitative or quantitative analysis is not a purely technical process, but influenced by the characteristics of the researchers and their disciplinary paradigms, critical reflection throughout the research process is paramount, including in the design of the study, the construction or collection of data, and the analysis. All Gale et al. (2013)\nIt is important to remember when using the Framework Method that, unlike quantitative research where data collection and data ana- lysis are strictly sequential and mutually exclusive stages of the research process, in qualitative analysis there is, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the project, ongoing interplay between data collection, analysis, and theory development. For example, new ideas or insights from participants may suggest potentially fruitful lines of enquiry, or close analysis might reveal subtle inconsistencies in an account which require further exploration.@gale2013using\nHere are the key steps involved in conducting a meta-framework analysis:\n\nIdentify relevant studies: Conduct a systematic search to identify qualitative studies related to the research topic. These studies may employ different theoretical frameworks, methodologies, or perspectives.\nExtract data: Extract relevant data from each included study, including key concepts, themes, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies used.\nCode and categorize: Analyze the extracted data by coding and categorizing the concepts, themes, and frameworks identified in the included studies. This process involves identifying similarities and differences across the studies.\nDevelop a meta-framework: Based on the coded data, develop a meta-framework that integrates the key concepts, themes, and theoretical frameworks identified in the included studies. The meta-framework should capture the overarching structure or framework that emerges from the synthesis of the individual studies.\nRefine the meta-framework: Iteratively refine the meta-framework by revisiting the coded data and ensuring that it accurately represents the diversity of perspectives and theories present in the included studies.\nAnalyze relationships: Analyze the relationships between different elements of the meta-framework, such as how concepts and themes from different theoretical frameworks relate to each other or intersect.\nInterpret findings: Interpret the findings of the meta-framework analysis in relation to the research question or objective. Discuss the implications of the synthesized framework for theory, practice, and future research.\nReport results: Write up the results of the meta-framework analysis, describing the methodology used, presenting the synthesized framework, and providing supporting evidence from the included studies.\n\nMeta-framework analysis offers a systematic approach to synthesizing qualitative research findings from diverse theoretical perspectives and methodologies. By integrating these perspectives into a cohesive framework, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field.\nFramework analysis consists of two major components: creating an analytic framework and applying this analytic framework. These two major components occur through five steps: (1) data familiarization; (2) identifying a thematic framework; (3) indexing all study data against the framework; (4) charting to summarize the indexed data; and (5) mapping and interpretation of patterns found within the charts (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). The hallmarks of framework analysis are found in the last three steps, namely the emphasis on systematic and comprehensive indexing across all the data (in step 3), the intentional organizing of the indexed data into a matrix format (in step 4), and comparative analysis within this matrix format to identify key patterns and abstractions (in step 5). Goldsmith (2021)\nThe framework approach has five stages (which share features of both the comparative and translational approaches to interpretive synthesis described above): 1 familiarisation with the data and/or studies (i.e. reading and re-reading) 2 identification of a thematic framework, typically derived form the research questions 3 indexing or coding of the data/ and/or studies 4 charting (i.e. transfer of summaries to matrix displays) 5 mapping and interpretation Mays, Popay, and Pope (2007)\nStep 1: Data Familiarization As the first step in the analysis, data familiarization provides the researcher with an initial, purposeful understanding of the data. Through immersion in the data and making notes about key ideas, the researcher begins to understand major themes in the data. Items that could be major themes include topics or issues that relate to the research question(s) and recur across the data. The data familiarization step continues until the researcher feels they have arrived at a reasonable initial understanding of the data, including the breadth of variation within the data (Spencer, Ritchie, O’Connor, et al., 2014) (…) the dataset volume or study timelines require purposeful sampling from the study dataset for the data familiarization step (…) Coding can be a part of the data familiarization process, but it is not required. Some researchers like to immediately start working with preliminary codes linked to data at this early stage, even if they are later deleted or heavily reworked. Other researchers prefer to take notes about their thoughts about and understanding of the data without explicitly linking these thoughts to portions of the data. Understanding major themes in the data—the desired outcome of the data familiarization stage—is not dependent on coding at this stage. Goldsmith (2021)\nStep 2: Framework Identification This second step moves the analysis from concrete descriptions of themes in the data to the identification of more abstract concepts, with the objective of providing a framework, or a structure for the analysis and the resulting interpretation. This framework or analytic structure is usually built from a combination of a priori and emergent concepts and themes (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). These themes and concepts are then grouped, ranked, or otherwise ordered in a way that helps the researcher address the focus of the study. Typically, frameworks are composed of major themes and concepts (hereafter called components), which are supported by other themes and concepts elaborating on or sub-dividing the major themes and concepts (hereafter called sub-components). Like many other forms of qualitative analysis, the typical framework structure can be thought of as a tree with many branches.(…) the identifying the framework step is an iterative process. An initial framework is tested against a manageable portion of the data and refined as necessary to move from simple description to conceptual abstractions (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). Refinements can include renaming components, identifying new components, deleting components, collapsing components, and reordering components. Similar refinements can also occur at the sub-component level. Goldsmith (2021)\nThe development of themes is a common feature of qualitative data analysis, involving the systematic search for patterns to generate full descriptions capable of shedding light on the phenomenon under investigation. In particular, many qualitative approaches use the ‘constant comparative method’, developed as part of Grounded Theory, which involves making systematic comparisons across cases to refine each theme [21,23]. Unlike Grounded Theory, the Framework Method is not necessarily concerned with generating social theory, but can greatly facilitate constant comparative techniques through the review of data across the matrix.@gale2013using\nI then worked through the three focus group transcripts, attaching text in the transcripts to the draft framework using a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) program. I created new framework components when I encountered text that did not fit the draft framework yet would be helpful for understanding the two provider types and the birth process. I also created sub-components where I felt it would be helpful to develop a more nuanced understanding of the data for this step. This approach resulted in the addition of sub- components throughout the framework plus two additional framework components (right column of Table 2). I considered whether I should reorder the components from the initial framework but did not see an obvious new order. I also knew that I could revisit the consideration of reordering through the next step.@goldsmith2021using\nCoding is a common part of the framework identification stage, although it is possible to arrive at a well-functioning framework without having engaged in explicit coding work. The emphasis at this stage is on completing the framework—the identification of the important themes and concepts and the conceptual relationship they have to each other—rather than an emphasis on how the important themes and concepts play out in the data. For identifying the framework in the TBA dataset, I chose to engage in explicit coding as I wanted a stronger handle on the data and the patterns within. I also chose to initiate this coding with a CAQDAS program rather than via pen and paper as I expected I would want the flexibility to quickly reorder, collapse, and split codes as my understanding of the data deepened. Had I been involved in the study design and data collection phases of the TBA study, I might have started the framework identification step with a strong grasp of the data and opted to complete the entirety of this step using pen and paper and without much explicit coding work .@goldsmith2021using\nStep 3: Indexing Once a reasonable framework has been identified, the next step in framework analysis is to systematically apply the framework to all of the study data (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). This process is called indexing as it resembles the process used to create the index of a book (Spencer, Ritchie, O’Connor, et al., 2014). The linking of study data and framework components can be accomplished using any approach with which the researcher is comfortable for coding data (e.g., pen and paper, using the comment function in a word processing program, or a CAQDAS program). Many researchers with access to a CAQDAS program will opt to use it at this stage to facilitate the data manipulation required in framework analysis’ subsequent steps (…) Before indexing can begin, the researcher must determine the appropriate way to link framework components with applicable study data. There is no standard linking structure to rely on like the page numbers in a book index. Rather, the study data are linked to framework components via the appropriate units of analysis—namely, the entities or items which are the focus of the study framework. For some frameworks, the data collection sampling units can also be used as the units of analysis. Other frameworks operate at a different altitude with respect to the study topic than was the case during the study’s initial design or data collection phases, necessitating using units of analysis which differ from the data collection sampling units. (See Goldsmith et al., 2017 for an example of framework analysis using units of analysis which differ from the data collection sampling units Goldsmith (2021)\nThe indexing step also provides an important opportunity for framework revision as applying the framework to all study data simultaneously necessitates assessing how well the framework works with and for the study data. Framework testing and revision tasks in the indexing step consist of affirming and amending the definitions and boundaries of each framework component and sub-component and adding to framework sub-components to accommodate new variation. The researcher may even encounter data in the indexing step for which the framework does not work, requiring revisiting the overall structure and contents of the framework. Regardless of what revisions are made, framework indexing and revision must continue in an iterative process until all data are indexed on the final framework.(…) By this point in time, I knew that the framework worked for all the data and I made no revisions to the framework. This is an unusual situation and readers should more often expect that indexing will be accomplished as a distinct step after framework identification and the framework is likely to be refined during the indexing step. Goldsmith (2021)\nStep 4: Charting The next step in framework analysis is a process of ordering and abstracting the now-indexed study data such that the data can be examined systematically and in totality. This is accomplished through creating one or more charts summarizing the study data. The chart(s) are organized in a matrix form, using ordered rows and columns populated by the units of analysis and the framework components. Although charting is primarily focused on summarizing the study data, charting is also dependent on the work done in the earlier steps of framework analysis. The act of charting is an opportunity to revisit and enhance earlier decisions around the appropriate units of analysis, the order of units of analysis and framework components, the appropriate level of data abstraction, and the adequacy of the framework for the data at hand (…) With respect to revisiting and enhancing decisions around the appropriate units of analysis, charting the indexed study data may make it obvious that it is not possible to carry forward one or more of the units of analysis from the indexing step. For Goldsmith (2021)\nWith respect to revisiting and enhancing the order of units of analysis and framework components, charting demands an explicit order to the layout of rows and columns. The researcher may not have needed to be concerned about imposing order on the units of analysis before now—data may have been indexed in the order that individuals were interviewed, for instance. And while framework components are more likely to already have order suggested by the earlier framework identification and indexing steps, the act of charting can still push the researcher to enhance the order of framework components. Regardless of the state of order of units of analysis and framework components prior to this step, the researcher uses the research questions and the developing analysis to ensure there is explicit and sufficient order to the units of analysis and framework components on the chart(s). Imposing order can be simple, such as grouping units of analysis by key characteristics. Goldsmith (2021)\nOnce the charting structure of the rows and columns is established, the researcher can move onto populating the interior cells of the chart(s). This requires reviewing the data in its indexed form (Spencer, Ritchie, O’Connor, et al., 2014) and determining or revisiting the appropriate level of abstraction for the data.@goldsmith2021using\nResearchers use a variety of approaches to create the chart or charts for their framework analyses. Some use pen and paper while others create charts using tables in word processing computer programs or spreadsheet computer programs (e.g., Swallow et al., 2003). Others use CAQDAS programs alone or in combination with aforementioned approaches to arrive at a completed chart (see Goldsmith et al., 2017 for an example of the latter). To the best of my knowledge, NVivo (version 9 and above) is the only CAQDAS program which facilitates the entirety of framework analysis, including charting, and allows for retaining live links between the cells in the chart and study data Goldsmith (2021)\nTo create the chart for the TBA dataset, I reviewed the study data by framework component and stakeholder group within the CAQDAS program and then manually entered my summary of the data in the relevant cell on a table I created in a word processing program (Table 3). The framework continued to work well for the TBA data, and no new framework components or sub-components were added to the chart Goldsmith (2021)\nThe charting step results in one or more charts, with the number of charts dependent on the data and the researcher’s preferences. Where the data are not manageable in a single chart, for example, the researcher may subdivide the data by framework components or by units of analysis. For the TBA dataset, it was possible to use a single chart as the combination of each framework and charted data could be reasonably assessed as a single whole. Goldsmith (2021)\nStep 5: Mapping and Interpretation The final step in framework analysis—mapping and interpretation—is where the researcher combines the key learnings from the earlier steps, including hunches about patterns to explore in the data, with comparisons across and within units of analysis and across and within framework components. Comparisons of potential interest at this step include examining variation across the entire dataset, examining variation within subgroups and subthemes, and looking for clusters of data. The charts and other data are reviewed, recombined, collapsed, or condensed as suggested by the study focus, data, and major patterns. The researcher is ultimately trying to tell a compelling story about how the data are structured and patterned Goldsmith (2021)\nThere is no single form of product from framework analysis. The results of mapping and interpretation can be shown in a variety of ways, including identifying and describing key concepts or the nature and range of particular phenomena; demonstrating associations across units of analysis for key concepts or particular phenomena; explaining attitudes, experiences and behaviors; and creating typologies (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). This list should not be seen as a complete list; the researcher is encouraged to be creative and follow the analysis to where the researcher is led even if the approach is not listed above. (See Ritchie & Spencer, 1994, for multiple varied examples of mapping and interpretation products). Goldsmith (2021)\nEL marco de Gale et al. Gale et al. (2013) consiste en estas etapas: 1) Transcription, 2) Familiarisation with the interview, 3) Coding, 4) Developing a working analytical framework, 5) Applying the analytical framework, 6) Charting data into the framework matrix, 7) Interpreting the data\nCoding: In more inductive studies, at this stage ‘open coding’ takes place, i.e. coding anything that might be relevant from as many different perspectives as possible. Codes could refer to substantive things (e.g. particular behaviours, incidents or structures), values (e.g. those that inform or underpin certain statements, such as a belief in evidence-based medicine or in patient choice), emotions (e.g. sorrow, frustration, love) and more impressionistic/methodological elements (e.g. interviewee found something difficult to explain, interviewee became emotional, interviewer felt uncomfortable) [33]. In purely deductive studies, the codes may have been pre-defined (e.g. by an existing theory, or specific areas of interest to the project) so this stage may not be strictly necessary and you could just move straight onto indexing, although it is generally helpful even if you are taking a broadly deductive approach to do some open coding on at least a few of the transcripts to ensure important aspects of the data are not missed.@gale2013using\nCoding aims to classify all of the data so that it can be compared systematically with other parts of the data set. (…) Coding can also be done digitally using CAQDAS, which is a useful way to keep track automatically of new codes. However, some researchers prefer to do the early stages of coding with a paper and pen, and only start to use CAQDAS once they reach Stage 5 (see below) Gale et al. (2013)\nStage 4: Developing a working analytical framework After coding the first few transcripts, all researchers involved should meet to compare the labels they have applied and agree on a set of codes to apply to all subsequent transcripts. Codes can be grouped together into categories (using a tree diagram if helpful), which are then clearly defined. This forms a working analytical framework. It is likely that several iterations of the analytical framework will be required before no additional codes emerge (…) the analytical framework is never ‘final’ until the last transcript has been coded. Gale et al. (2013)\nStage 5: Applying the analytical framework The working analytical framework is then applied by indexing subsequent transcripts using the existing categories and codes. Each code is usually assigned a number or abbreviation for easy identification (and so the full names of the codes do not have to be written out each time) and written directly onto the transcripts. Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) is particularly useful at this stage because it can speed up the process and ensures that, at later stages, data is easily retrievable. It is worth noting that unlike software for statistical analyses, which actually carries out the calculations with the correct instruction, putting the data into a qualitative analysis soft- ware package does not analyse the data; it is simply an effective way of storing and organising the data so that they are accessible for the analysis process. Gale et al. (2013)\nStage 6: Charting data into the framework matrix Qualitative data are voluminous (an hour of interview can generate 15–30 pages of text) and being able to manage and summarize (reduce) data is a vital aspect of the analysis process. A spreadsheet is used to generate a matrix and the data are ‘charted’ into the matrix. Charting involves summarizing the data by category from each transcript. Good charting requires an ability to strike a balance between reducing the data on the one hand and retaining the original meanings and ‘feel’ of the interviewees’ words on the other. The chart should include references to interesting or illustrative quotations. These can be tagged automatically if you are using CAQDAS to manage your data Gale et al. (2013)\nStage 7: Interpreting the data It is useful throughout the research to have a separate note book or computer file to note down impressions, ideas and early interpretations of the data. It may be worth breaking off at any stage to explore an interesting idea, concept or potential theme by writing an analytic memo [20,21] to then discuss with other members of the research team, including lay and clinical members (…) Gradually, characteristics of and differences between the data are identified, perhaps generating typologies, interrogating theoretical concepts (either prior concepts or ones emerging from the data) or mapping connections between categories to explore relationships and/or causality. If the data are rich enough, the findings generated through this process can go beyond description of particular cases to explanation of, for example, reasons for the emergence of a phenomena, predicting how an organisation or other social actor is likely to instigate or respond to a situation, or identifying areas that are not functioning well within an organisation or system. It is worth noting that this stage often takes longer than anticipated and that any project plan should ensure that sufficient time is allocated to meetings and individual researcher time to conduct interpretation and writing up of findings (see Additional file 1, Section 7). Gale et al. (2013)\nthe existing model acted as the basis for the synthesis and could be built-upon, expanded upon, reduced or added to by these new data. Each reviewer checked and examined critically the extraction and categorisation or coding of data performed by the other. The principal aim of this process was to examine the first reviewer’s categorisation of the data, i.e. either to verify the coding or to challenge it by offering an alternative.(…) A consensus was reached on which a priori themes were supported by the data, and whether new themes identified by the reviewers did actually map either to a pre-existing theme or to one another (c.p. reciprocal translation [2]). The result was a finalised list of themes. The primary reviewer (CC) then offered an interpretation of the relationships between the themes based in part on the relationships as they were represented in the original model (see Figure 1), and also based on the data itself, which suggested, for example, that “the media” inputted into the central procedural themes of both perceived need and decision- making. The new model was then critically considered by all reviewers. A revised conceptual model was therefore developed building on the earlier, identified model, to describe and explain people’s views around the taking of potential chemopreventive agents. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nData synthesis and development of model A combination of coding against pre-existing themes and the generation of and assignment of data to new, agreed themes, generated the model presented in Figure 2. A full description of the evidence supporting this model is published elsewhere [8]. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011) (ver el framework que presenta en el artículo)\n(esta es la referencia a la figura del cuadro con el Framework) The model describes the processes involved in an individual’s decision about whether or not to take possible chemopreventive agents. The process runs from the first stages of perceived need, on the left, through the decision-making process itself, to final non- use or use, and maintenance of use, on the right.@carroll2011worked\n(y sigue la explicación comparando el Framework 1 obtenido de la literatura, con el Framework 2 que es al que llegan los autores) Since the source of the preliminary framework was a single published model, the manner in which new themes built-on, developed and altered this preliminary conceptual framework is quite transparent. In this review, this may be assessed in part by comparing Figure 1 with Figure 2. The principal procedural elements of the preliminary model also held true for this sample of studies and their population, i.e. the transition through the stages of perceived need, decision-making, risk versus benefit and use or non-use. These elements also reflect the three key stages of Contemplation,… Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nThe a priori identification of these key constructs (en el Framework 1) therefore enabled therapid coding of studydatafromthisreviewagainst these tested and highly relevant components of health behaviour decision-making. The preliminary framework also provided “themes” that informed the “perceived need” and “decision-making” stages of the model (see numbers 1-9 in Figure 1). Once clear definitions had been applied to each of these themes, the study data were coded rapidly against them. Very little study data were coded against the themes of “Spending capacity” (or “Costs”)and “Access: obtaining the agent”,which may reflect differences in the cultural context of the preliminary conceptual model (a low-income country in South America) compared with the studies included in the review (principally UK, Europe and North America). However, relatively more substantial amounts of data were coded against the remaining themes. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nExtension of the preliminary conceptual framework to generate the final model Despite these helpful overlaps, which permitted rapid and reliable coding of much data from the included stu- dies, the preliminary model lacked sufficient depth or complexity to explain all the data in the included studies. (… lo que sigue es el ejemplo de explicación) All of these characteristics were found in the included studies to affect perceived need and decision- making. It was felt that the pre-existing theme of “personal factors” alone was insufficient to illustrate the complexity of factors at play. The role of age, gender and the physical properties of agents were new factors identified by the synthesis affecting the a priori theme of use, which were absent from the original conceptual model. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\n(y sigue con la comparativa entre frameworks) Relationships between the themes were not well-developed in the preliminary model. The synthesis found that not only did family, physicians and others affect decision making, but also that this relationship was moderated by the credibility of the source and the clarity of the infor- mation being given. (…) Indeed, unlike the existing models, which appear to be exclusively linear, the model that resulted from this synthesis was potentially more recursive: the decision-making stage might still be revisited on the basis of side-effects (“risks”) experienced at the stage of use. This new model can therefore be seen not only to validate, but also to build upon, extend and contextualise existing, relevant published models. The a priori boxes of Contemplation, i.e. perceived need; Determination, i.e. decision-making; and Action, i.e. use and maintenance, have been opened to reveal the complexities of the factors therein, their relationships and moderators. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\n(Sobre las diferencias/desviaciones entre los enfoques habituales y el empleado por los autores) This approach differs from other published versions of framework synthesis in which the apriori framework was developed from a range of sources, including familiarisation with and consultation around the published background literature, both theoretical and empirical, and personal experiences [5,6]. The approach taken here is of potential value for systematic reviewers as it does not require such extensive literature review, consultations or topic expertise to develop an a priori framework before embarking on the review itself. This may be of particular value when undertaking a synthesis of qualitative evidence within the limited timeframes of a health technology Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\n(y sigue con la justificación) However, if a framework of related, relevant concepts already exists, then the approach used here permits a far more rapid identification of the a priori framework; it also permits more rapid and structured coding and synthesis of data from the review’s included studies than grounded-theory techniques. In this way, where existing theories or models exist, they can be tested against the evidence for the review’s own particular criteria and evidence. This approach is therefore potentially more pragmatic than other forms of qualitative data synthesis (…) Furthermore it provided a mechanism for flagging up and explicitly communicating diver- gent findings or themes within the review team. The resultant synthetic product is expressed as an enhanced model recording each key dimension identified; the nature of the concepts under study; and associations between themes and tensions between them [6] Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\n\n3.4.1 Literature selection\nCriterios para elegir la literatura primaria y complementaria. Criterios de búsqueda en base de datos.\nA systematic search to identify relevant studies was performed by an information specia- list following piloting of appropriate search strategies. The search combined terms describing the agents of interest (NSAIDs, aspirin, vitamins, etc.) with a pub- lished, validated filter for identifying qualitative studies, together with the medical subject heading “qualitative research” [11]. The full search strategy is available in the Appendix (…) Study selection To be included in the review, a study had to focus on exploring the attitudes, perceptions and beliefs of adults (any country) surrounding the taking of the agents listed above, through qualitative data from interviews or focus groups, and cross-sectional data from satisfaction sur- veys,i.e.unstructured andstructured, but often textual data describing people’s own, personal, subjective experiences, views or attitudes relating to the interven- tion of interest. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nTo uncover peer reviewed research on school-based positive education interventions, a systematic literature search was conducted using the four databases of: Scopus®, Google Scholar, PsycINFO®, and Web of Science®. Additionally, the reference lists of review articles that were identified through the above search were cross-checked using the ancestry method outlined in Lyubomirsky et al. (2005), in order to capture the broadest collection of relevant articles possible. To qualify for inclusion, studies had to meet eight key criteria. First, the study had to be peer-reviewed and published in an academic journal and, thus, have withstood the scrutiny of the peer review process. Second, the (…) Waters and Loton (2019)\nSeventy-five school-based positive education intervention studies were identified as meeting the criteria above and form the basis of this review. Table One provides definitions of the six SEARCH pathways and lists the sub-categories of interventions that were identified in each pathway for the current review. Waters and Loton (2019)\nFor consistency across the presentation of the review findings, the same structure has been used when mapping each of the six pathways to the studies identified. First, the specific interventions that can be mapped to each pathway are identified. For example, under the pathway of attention and awareness, the specific interventions identified in the school-based interventions were mindfulness and meditation (…)Waters and Loton (2019)\nFinally, and most importantly, the evidence supporting each pathway is considered. This evaluation is structured around the three key research questions listed in the former section and considers how the evidence meets Seligman et al.’s(2009) broad aims of positive education: to improve both wellbeing and academic outcomes.@waters2019search 3.2 Pathway One: Strengths\nLiterature searching and analysis Our literature searches across medicine, nursing, social welfare and the social sciences covered reports published in academic journals and patient- and carer-group publications, and unpublished reports accessible through professional and patient or public networks. As we accumulated literature, we followed an iterative process similar to framework analysis as applied to primary research data (ver Ritchie). This involved familiarization with the literature; gradually developing a conceptual framework using concepts embedded in the review question, and in the theoretical and empirical literature; applying the framework systematically to the data; and subsequently rearranging the data within the framework in order to construct a chart for each key dimension with distilled summaries from all relevant documents identified. The charts were then used to map the range and nature of involvement and find associations between themes with a view to providing explanations for the findings. We describe below the key concepts used to build our framework, and how these were combined so as to enable us to analyse and draw conclusions from the literature. Oliver et al. (2008)\nCategorizing the literature As well as reports of public involvement, we found discussion papers about differing priorities, conceptual frameworks, community equi- poise, power, democratic practice and advocacy. These papers drew on a wide range of theories, and described episodes of involvement in many different research areas. (…)The health topics covered in the literature included different health conditions (asthma, breastfeeding (…) The papers came from different disciplines (agricul- ture, genetics, environmental studies) and reported different research methodologies (sys- tematic reviews, technology assessment, participatory research). Oliver et al. (2008)\nReports of public involvement were first characterized as ÔpurposefulÕ, ÔopportunisticÕ or ÔindirectÕ. (a continuación hay que explicar a qué se refiere cada) Oliver et al. (2008)\nFramework analysis is designed so that it can be viewed and assessed by people other than the primary analyst. Consequently, framework analysis in a systematic review displays the data in such a way that readers can navigate the charts to find evidence relevant to their circumstances (in this case, for instance, international or national programmes or individual projects), or to the options available to them (e.g. patient organizations responding to consultations or only entering collaborative partnerships or taking the initiative). Applying the framework to these data reveals the theories that have been applied to work constructively with individuals,23,24 or within organizations (…) Thus, readers can draw out for themselves relevant implications for their policy and practice from what is known about public involvement in research agenda setting Oliver et al. (2008)\nPublished descriptions of framework synthesis typically exclude studies of lower quality. However this was not the approach used in this case, representing a further innovative deviation from the published method [2]. All studies that satisfied the relevance criteria were included because there is an increasingly strong case for not excluding qualitative data studies from evidence synth- esis based on quality assessment [1,18,19].(…) Studies were assessed using key quality criteria derived from relevant critical appraisal checklists for qualitative studies [20] and other systematic reviews of people’s views [1,2]. These elements also appear in recent guidance from the Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group [21]Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\n\n\n3.4.2 Method\nMecanismo utilizado para identificar “themes” relevantes. Tabla de “Themes” -&gt; Resumen de la “rationale” + Fuentes donde aparecen en la literatura\nThe review was conducted in three parts. First, we searched for and mapped the existing research literature on the general public’s views of walking and cycling. Second, we conducted an in-depth review of a subset of this literature, the scope of which was selected by our Advisory Group, focusing on the views of children, young people and parents. Third, we synthesised the findings relating to these ‘views studies’ together with the research on interventions carried out by Ogilvie et al. (2004). The overall conclusions of the review are thus based both on international evaluations of specific interventions, and from findings of recent ‘qualitative’ research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) examining the views and experiences of children, young people and parents. Brunton et al. (2006)\nAnalysis of this research revealed four recurrent themes drawn from the views of children, young people and parents: a culture of car use; fear and dislike of local environments; children as responsible transport users; and parental responsibility and behaviour.@brunton2006synthesis\n\n\n3.4.3 Inductive vs Deductive Approach\nHowever, the tool itself has no allegiance to either inductive or deductive thematic analysis; where the research sits along this inductive-deductive continuum depends on the research question.@gale2013using\nThe differencewould become apparent in how themes are selected: in the deductive approach, themes and codes are pre-selected based on previous literature, previous theories or the specifics of the research question; whereas in the inductive approach, themes are generated from the data though open (unrestricted) coding, followed by refinement of themes. In many cases, a combined approach is appropriate when the project has some specific issues to explore, but also aims to leave space to discover other unexpected aspects of the participants’ experience or the way they assign meaning to phenomena. In sum, the Framework Method can be adapted for use with deductive, inductive, or combined types of qualitative analysis.@gale2013using\n\n\n3.4.4 Flaws of Framework Method\nThe method is however dependent on the identification of an appropriate existing conceptual model.( )…) it required search strategies that aimed to maximise the likelihood of retrieving a model of pragmatic utility to the project; the aim was not the systematic identification of all such models.@carroll2011worked\nSome issues were encountered when piloting this “best fit” framework synthesis method. When initially seeking to code the extracted data from the included studies using the themes derived from the relevant model, the two reviewers were not always coding the same data against the same themes. It therefore became apparent that each of the a priori themes had to be clearly defined in order to facilitate the coding process (…) The subsequent provision of clear consensual definitions not only enhanced the reliability of the coding, but also strengthened the rigour of the synthesis. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nIt further became apparent that additional analysis was needed to interpret and analyse data which could not be reliably assigned to any of the pre-existing, apriori themes, or, in the case of “personal factors”,forwhich the pre-existing theme was inadequate. In this sense the usefulness of a particular framework is not only deter- mined by “conceptual fit” but also by pragmatic concerns of what proportion of the study data can be accommodated within it. Further thematic analysis of data from the included studies was therefore required. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nThe resulting agreed new themes were then incorporated with the pre-existing themes into a new conceptual model that captured the data and reflected a possible network of relationships between those data-driven themes. The Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nFinally, this review did not exclude studies on the basis of quality, thereby deviating from one element of the published description of framework synthesis [2]. The internal validity of a review depends in part on the quality of included studies and the reliability of their findings. Currently there is much debate and little consensus around the feasibility and usefulness of quality assessments of qualitative studies in evidence synthesis [18].(…) Some techniques, such as meta-ethnography [4], and the previously published form of framework synth- esis, actively exclude studies on the basis of the quality assessment.(…) All twenty included studies were assessed as being of similar, generally satisfactory “quality”, so, from this perspective, study quality did not provide a poten- tial explanation for any differences in findings. The issue of the inclusion or exclusion of studies for this type of synthesis, based on their assessed quality, therefore remains unresolved based on this case study. Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)\nIt is also the case that an apparently appropriate a priori model may be found only to accommodate a small proportion of the data from a review’s included studies. In such a case, secondary thematic analysis would form the principal approach to synthesis, thus reducing the major potential pragmatic benefits of the best-fit approach described in this paper. Reviewers must therefore exercise careful consideration of the potential external validity of existing models based on the behaviour and population of interest Carroll, Booth, and Cooper (2011)"

    "text": "3.5 Other Alternative Methods\nMeta-synthesis\nThematic analysis (TA) is a technique for the analysis of qualitative data which allows you to identify or develop patterns of meaning and/or central ideas that unify them (referred to as themes) pertaining to a given set of data. You will then use these themes to organize, describe or interpret (perceptions of) reality (Boyatzis, 1998; Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2021). Once (relationships among) themes are identified, you need to interpret their relevance and implications for the research question you aim to answer. Verbal individual or group interviews (see King et al. 2018), focus group data (see Barbour, 2008) or textual data (written material) are usually at the core of thematic research. Nevertheless, video material and images might also be thematically analysed (Joffe, 2012).@stevens2022qualitative\n\n3.5.1 Atlas.ti\nProcess (according to Atlas.ti): Thematic framework: Central to framework analysis is the development of a framework identifying key themes, concepts, and relationships in the data. The framework guides the subsequent stages of coding and charting.\nFlexibility: While it provides a clear structure, framework analysis is also adaptable. Depending on the objectives of the study, researchers can modify the process to better suit their data and questions.\nIterative process: The process in framework analysis is not linear. As data is collected and data analysis progresses, researchers often revisit earlier stages, refining the framework or revising codes to better capture the nuances in the data.*\nBenefits of framework analysis Conducting framework analysis has several advantages:\nRigorous data management: The structured approach means data is managed and analyzed with a high level of rigor, minimizing the potential influence of preconceptions.\nInclusivity: Framework analysis accommodates both a priori issues, driven by the research questions, and emergent issues that arise from the data itself.\nComparability: Given its structured nature, framework analysis allows researchers to compare and contrast data, facilitating the identification of patterns and differences.\nAccessibility: By presenting data in a summarized, charted form, findings from framework analysis become more accessible and comprehensible, aiding in reporting and disseminating results.\nRelevance for applied research: Given its origins in policy research and its clear focus on addressing specific research questions, framework analysis is particularly relevant for studies aiming to inform policy or practice.\nImplementing Familiarization with the data Before discussing a more detailed analysis, it’s paramount to understand the breadth and depth of the data at hand.\nReading and re-reading: Begin by reading textual data such as transcripts, field notes, and other data sources multiple times. This immersion allows researchers to understand participants’ perspectives and grasp the overall context.\nNoting preliminary ideas: As researchers familiarize themselves with the data, preliminary themes or ideas may start to emerge. Jotting these down in memos helps in forming an initial understanding and can be instrumental in the subsequent phase of developing a set of themes.\nDeveloping a thematic framework As is the case across nearly all types of qualitative methodology, central to framework analysis is the construction of a robust analytical framework. This structure aids in organizing and interpreting the data.\nIdentifying key themes: Based on the initial familiarization, it’s important to identify themes that occur in the multimedia or textual data. These themes should be relevant to the research question. Researchers can begin assigning codes to specific chunks of data to capture emerging themes.\nCategorizing and coding: Each identified theme can further be broken down into sub-themes or brought together under categories. At this stage, researchers can continue coding (or recoding) their data according to these themes or categories.\nRefining the framework: As the analysis progresses, the initial themes represented by your coding framework may need adjustments. It’s an iterative process, where the framework can be continually refined to better fit the data.\nIndexing and charting the data Once the framework is established, the next phase involves systematically applying it to the data.\nIndexing: Using the resulting coding framework, you can verify that codes have been systematically assigned to relevant portions of the data. This ensures every relevant piece of data is categorized under the appropriate theme or sub-theme.\nCharting: This step involves creating charts or matrices for each theme. Data from different sources (like interviews or focus groups) is summarized under the relevant theme. For example, a table can be created with each theme in a column and each data source in a row, and researchers can then populate the cells with relevant data extracts or notes. These charts provide a visual representation, allowing researchers to easily see patterns or discrepancies in the data.\nMapping and Interpretation: With the data systematically charted, researchers can begin to map the relationships between themes and interpret the broader implications. This step is where the true essence of the research emerges, as researchers link the patterns in the data to the broader objectives of the study.\nFramework analysis is an involved process, with intentional decision-making at every step of the way. As a result, implementing structured qualitative methodologies such as framework analysis requires patience, meticulous attention to detail, and a clear understanding of the research objectives. When conducted diligently, it offers a transparent and systematic approach to analyzing qualitative data, ensuring the research not only has depth but also clarity.\nWhether comparing data across multiple sources or drilling down into the nuances of individual narratives, framework analysis equips researchers with the tools needed to derive meaningful insights from their qualitative data. As more researchers across disciplines recognize its value, it stands to become an even more integral part of the research landscape."

    "text": "3.6 Benefits\nPutting more time into specifying the model, using a wider range of literature, and gaining the views of a wider range of stakeholders may all be important in improving the legitimacy and validity of any ensuring synthesis Dixon-Woods (2011).\nOne possible reason for framework analysis’ popularity is its potential for predictability and efficiency. When paired with a targeted research question and similarly targeted data, framework analysis can be accomplished quickly (Pope et al., 2000). The explicit steps already built into framework analysis can provide clear structure for and boundaries on the analysis. Framework analysis’ straightforward and systematic approach can also allow for easy entry for novice researchers and ease of use in multi- disciplinary and mixed-methods research teams (Gale Goldsmith (2021)\nQualitative researchers use framework analysis for a variety of additional reasons beyond ease of use. Framework analysis can be successfully used for analyzing large, complex qualitative datasets, such as can occur in policy research across multiple jurisdictions or geographies. Framework analysis can be used to methodically describe a population of interest including the notable variation contained within that population. Researchers can also use framework analysis to push beyond a thematic description of a phenomenon to the development of multi-dimensional typologies or theory development. Regardless of the purpose for which framework analysis is employed, systematic movement through the steps of framework analysis naturally provides an explicit audit trail (Parkinson et al., 2016; Smith & Firth, 2011). The methods and results of framework analysis can also be presented in transparent and accessible ways for a variety of audiences, meeting the dependability and credibility needs of applied researchers and applied research funders (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994).@goldsmith2021using\nWhile framework analysis can be simple and straightforward under the right conditions, framework analysis is not inherently simple, quick or undemanding. Researchers undertaking framework analysis, for instance, must be prepared to work both systematically and dynamically (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). Goldsmith (2021)\nFramework analysis’ demand for structure and order pushed the TBA dataset analysis beyond the simple listing of themes, which further benefitted the comparison between stakeholder groups. The charting and mapping demands of framework analysis also meant that each theme was reviewed for each stakeholder group, highlighting variation between stakeholders and helping to surface policy- relevant silences in the data. The results of this framework analysis then helped identify gaps needing bridging before expecting stronger working relationships between TBAs and formal health care workers.@goldsmith2021using\nThe benefits of framework analysis’ order and structure can extend beyond the study completion. As already mentioned in the introduction, the explicitness of the steps of framework analysis provides an easily understandable audit trail and provides non-research audiences access to the inner workings of the analysis. Such transparency can increase the willingness of policy makers, the public, and other knowledge users to engage with and use the research to understand and solve policy problems. Framework analysis’ transparency can also be harnessed for future qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research.@goldsmith2021using\nI add my voice to others in demonstrating that framework analysis is both a powerful and flexible method for analyzing a variety of types of qualitative data, including secondary data. The examples in this paper and elsewhere show that framework analysis has been effectively used by solo researchers, by teams of qualitative researchers, and by multi-disciplinary and mixed-methods research teams. There are myriad reasons for applied researchers to use framework analysis, including transparency of process and a long and successful track record for better understanding of policy issues and social problems to help policy makers, service deliverers, and other knowledge users with improving program design and decision making. Results from applied research studies using framework analysis have also contributed to better theorizing about phenomena of interest and improvements in the design of future research of any type, whether that future research is qualitative or quantitative, or basic or applied. In sum, framework analysis has value to applied fields and beyond. I hope this paper encourages applied researchers to consider using framework analysis and to employ framework analysis with confidence and rigour. Goldsmith (2021)\nIt is not aligned with a particular epistemological viewpoint or theoretical approach and therefore can be adapted for use in inductive or deductive analysis or a combination of the two (e.g. using pre-existing theoretical constructs deductively, then revising the theory with inductive aspects; or using an inductive approach to identify themes in the data, before returning to the literature and using theories deductively to help further explain certain themes). - It is easy to identify relevant data extracts to illustrate themes and to check whether there is sufficient evidence for a proposed theme. - Finally, there is a clear audit trail from original raw data to final themes, including the illustrative quotes Gale et al. (2013)\nThe process enables the researcher to track decisions which ensures links between the original data and findings are maintained and transparent. This adds to the rigour of the research process and enhances the validity of the findings Smith and Firth (2011)\nPurpose of Meta-Framework\n\nA meta-framework is understood as an overarching frame for what should inform the analysis and eventually the design of STI practice frameworks, meaning frameworks used by or provided for transportation policy and planning bodies to select and apply indicators for sustainable transportation. The meta-framework is not a general theory, nor a master framework to be adopted directly by agencies, but a classification and evaluation device. Cornet and Gudmundsson (2015)\nComparative analysis based on the meta-framework could identify common features and gaps, and be used as a basis for testing hypotheses regarding how indicators influence decisions on option generation, design, operation, maintenance and other aspects of transportation systems. Eventually it should help evolve sustainability measurement in transportation planning from a position as a niche, ad hoc, or add-on activity into something like an “Organizing Principle for Transportation Agencies”, as it has recently been formulated (21). Cornet and Gudmundsson (2015)\nTherefore, rather than a ‘recipe’ to be applied directly by agencies, the meta-framework is first and foremost a scheme for further empirical analysis of existing frameworks. The next step is to refine and apply the criteria via empirical analysis of how frameworks have been developed and used in real world conditions. Eventually this will allow for building a robust set of criteria based on theory as well as realism Cornet and Gudmundsson (2015)\n\nMethodologically the authors found this “best fit” approach to framework synthesis, as developed and tested in this review, to be a useful, fairly rapid and reli- able and, above all, pragmatic method of synthesising qualitative data. This “best fit” approach to synthesis was therefore found to work well overall, particularly within the role previously identified as an existing strength, namely for testing existing potentially generalisable theories and models within a specific context. However, such a “best fit” approach would benefit from further testing and refinement.@carroll2011worked\nThe authors suggest that this “best fit” approach occupies a pragmatic middle ground between grounded theory-type and framework based syntheses and acknowledge the need for further evaluation carroll2011worked"

    "text": "3.7 The pearl-growing technique\nIt is a method used in qualitative research to identify additional sources of information or relevant studies based on the references, citations, or recommendations found in already identified sources. The name “pearl-growing” metaphorically refers to the process of gradually accumulating valuable “pearls” of information as researchers expand their search based on leads found in the initial set of sources.\nHere’s how the pearl-growing technique typically works:\nInitial search: Researchers begin by conducting an initial literature search using databases, search engines, or other sources to identify relevant sources related to their research topic.\nReview of references: Once relevant sources are identified, researchers carefully review the reference lists or bibliographies of these sources. They pay particular attention to the sources cited within the papers, as well as any recommended readings provided by the authors.\nIdentification of additional sources: Researchers then use the references found in the initial set of sources to identify additional studies, articles, books, or other materials that may contain relevant information or contribute to their understanding of the topic.\nIterative process: The process of reviewing references and identifying additional sources is iterative, meaning that researchers continue to expand their search based on the leads found in each round of searching. This process may involve reviewing the references of newly identified sources and repeating the search until saturation is reached, meaning that no new relevant sources are being found.\nEvaluation of relevance: As new sources are identified, researchers evaluate their relevance to the research question or objectives. They consider factors such as the alignment of the content with the research topic, the quality of the source, and its potential contribution to the overall understanding of the topic.\nIncorporation into the analysis: Finally, researchers incorporate the findings from the additional sources into their analysis or synthesis of the literature. They integrate these new insights with those obtained from the initial set of sources to develop a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.\nThe pearl-growing technique is valuable for ensuring that researchers identify a diverse range of perspectives, theories, and findings relevant to their research topic. By systematically expanding their search based on the references found in already identified sources, researchers can enhance the depth and breadth of their literature review and increase the likelihood of identifying important insights and contributions to the field.\nThe methodology uses the bases of a meta-theory and meta-history, parting from a seminal work in that of Marshall. From there the author draws and follows a timeline with which a progress in the motivations and contributions made by biology in economics and business studies can be traced. - How a seminal work is defined? - How the author decides to entertain around a certain seminal work and the works around it?\nThe meta-analysis is nit exhaustive not complete, The conclusions are extracted once saturation is achieved Barnett-Page and Thomas (2009).\nPaterson et al described meta-synthesis as a process which creates a new interpretation which accounts for the results of all three elements of analysis; however, they do not make it clear exactly how all three components of analysis are brought together to achieve this „new interpretation‟."

    "text": "3.8 Differences with systematic review\nMeta-synthesis and systematic literature review are both methods used in qualitative research to synthesize findings from multiple studies, but they differ in their objectives, approaches, and synthesis techniques. Here are the key differences between meta-synthesis and systematic literature review:\n\nObjective:\n\nMeta-synthesis: The primary objective of meta-synthesis is to integrate and interpret qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new understandings, theories, or conceptual frameworks. Meta-synthesis aims to generate insights that go beyond the individual studies and provide a deeper understanding of the research topic.\nSystematic literature review: The primary objective of a systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a particular topic. It aims to summarize and critically evaluate the findings of relevant studies, identify gaps or inconsistencies in the literature, and provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge.\n\nApproach:\n\nMeta-synthesis: Meta-synthesis typically involves a qualitative analysis approach, where researchers extract, analyze, and interpret qualitative data from multiple studies. It often involves thematic analysis, constant comparison, or other qualitative synthesis techniques to identify common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies.\nSystematic literature review: Systematic literature reviews can involve both qualitative and quantitative research methods, depending on the nature of the research question and available literature. They follow a systematic and transparent process for searching, selecting, appraising, and synthesizing studies, often using predetermined criteria and structured data extraction forms.\n\nSynthesis technique:\n\nMeta-synthesis: In meta-synthesis, researchers synthesize qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new interpretations, theories, or frameworks. This synthesis may involve identifying common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies, as well as exploring relationships, contradictions, or divergent perspectives within the data.\nSystematic literature review: In a systematic literature review, the synthesis may involve summarizing and categorizing the findings of included studies, identifying trends or patterns in the data, and providing a narrative or descriptive synthesis of the literature. The focus is on summarizing and synthesizing existing knowledge rather than generating new interpretations or theories.\n\nOutput:\n\nMeta-synthesis: The output of a meta-synthesis is often a synthesized framework, model, or theory that integrates findings from multiple qualitative studies. This output provides a deeper understanding of the research topic and may generate new insights or perspectives.\nSystematic literature review: The output of a systematic literature review is typically a comprehensive summary of the existing literature, including key findings, trends, gaps, and recommendations for future research. It provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge on the topic and may inform practice, policy, or further research.\n\n\nIn summary, while both meta-synthesis and systematic literature review involve synthesizing findings from multiple studies, they differ in their objectives, approaches, synthesis techniques, and output. Meta-synthesis aims to develop new interpretations or frameworks based on qualitative data, while systematic literature reviews provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a topic."

    "text": "3.9 Similarities with other quality approaches\nThe Framework Method sits within a broad family of analysis methods often termed thematic analysis or qualitative content analysis. These approaches identify commonalities and differences in qualitative data, before focusing on relationships between different parts of the data, thereby seeking to draw descriptive and/or explanatory conclusions clustered around themes Gale et al. (2013)\n\nThematic analysis Stevens (2023) for Boyatzis, the aim of a TA is not only to identify themes, measure their frequency (e.g., by number of cases), or cluster them in groups, but also to detect relationships among them. You might therefore start by trying to understand if there is a relationship among specific themes and what type of relationship that is. Once you identify a relationship among themes, you for- malize this relationship into a meta-theme. If two or more themes are brought together in a meta-theme, you will then aim to understand what that meta-theme is about and interpret how it might help you to further understand the phenomenon that you are studying\n\nFramework analysis is an inherently comparative form of thematic analysis which employs an organized structure of inductively- and deductively-derived themes (i.e., a framework) to conduct cross-sectional analysis using a combination of data description and abstraction. Goldsmith (2021)\nGenerating themes from data is a common feature of qualitative methods and a widely used analytical method. Thematic analysis is an interpretive process, whereby data is systematically searched to identify patterns within the data in order to provide an illuminating description of the phenomenon. The process results in the development of meaningful themes without explicitly generating theory (Tesch 1990). Thematic analysis can provide rich and insightful understandings of complex phenomena, be applied across a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches, and expand on or test existing theory (Braun and Clark 2006). However, thematic analysis has been criticised for lacking depth, fragmenting the phenomena being studied, being subjective and lacking transparency in relation to the development of themes, which can result in difficulties when judging the rigour of the findings (Attride-Stirling 2001). Smith and Firth (2011)\nThe framework approach has many similarities to thematic analysis, particularly in the initial stages when recurring and significant themes are identified. However, analytical frameworks such as thematic networks and the framework approach appear to have a greater emphasis (…) on making the process of data analysis transparent and illustrating the linkage between the stages of the analysis (Pope et al 2000, Ritchie and Lewis 2003, Braun and Clark 2006). Central to the analytical processes within the framework approach is a series of interconnected stages that enables the researcher to move back and forth across the data until a coherent account emerges (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). This results in the constant refinement of themes which may lead to the development of a conceptual framework.

These tools are essentially of two kinds:\n• “top-down” approaches, where the main characteristics of the different frameworks are presented in what might be viewed as a structured inventory – drawing on Dutch experience with the Generic Referential ICT Profiles (GRIP) approach (Hacquebard, 2005) , and\n• “bottom-up” approaches, where each profile specification is analysed in terms of the underlying units of competence, skills and knowledge (the e-Competences and Certifications Observatory (eCCO) project, researching the use of “Knowledge Objects” as the “underlying unit”, leads developments here). A summary of the principles of the eCCO approach is presented in Annex G.\nThis CWA uses the Top-down approach, but supports the development of complementary Bottom-up approaches as potentially providing more rigorous analysis for comparison and design.

    "text": "4.1 SEARCH: A Systematic Review\nFollowing the development and refinement of SEARCH as a meta-framework for positive education, the focus of the current paper is to conduct a systematic review of the educational literature to examine evidence of the six pathways in student samples and consider the ways these pathways can be increased in students through existing school-based interventions to boost wellbeing and academic achievement.@waters2019search\nThe current review paper was guided by the three below questions, for each of the six SEARCH pathways\n1) What evidence is there to indicate that the intervention boosts the pathway it is targeting? For example, do mindfulness interventions actually boost attention and awareness? 2) What evidence is there to indicate that the intervention builds wellbeing? 3) What evidence is there to indicate that the intervention improves school-based and academic outcomes? Waters and Loton (2019)\n5. CROSS-STUDY SYNTHESIS 5. Cross-study synthesis Having reviewed systematically the views of children, young people and parents about walking and cycling as a means of transport, we compared these views with evidence derived for the review by Ogilvie and colleagues (2004) of the effects of interventions promoting walking and cycling as a means of transport. Implications for interventions highlighted by our views synthesis were entered into a matrix alongside the included and excluded evaluations of interventions from the review of intervention effectiveness by Ogilvie et al. (2004). This table is provided in Appendix 8. We then examined the matrix to determine whether interventions matched, contradicted or simply failed to address children’s, young people’s or parents’ views. Theme 1: Culture of car use Brunton et al. (2006)\nReflections on the framework and its value The framework we developed and have described in this paper is comprehensive in its scope. It accommodates diverse methods for public involvement in research, operating at international, national, regional and local levels, in urban and rural areas, stretching across the developed and developing world, and in contexts that differ widely in terms of topic of interest, organizational structures and under- pinning theories. The framework draws toge- ther examples of public involvement that share fundamental principles, but that have devel- oped in very different contexts (such as participatory research with Californian young people and with farmers in developing countries). Oliver et al. (2008)\nIt distinguishes between variables operating at different levels; at initiation, and subsequent choice of participants, forum and decision- making processes. It juxtaposes public involvement methods that share characteristics along one or more dimensions. Application of the framework facilitates the identification of general trends (such as collaborative relation- ships being more productive), and highlights exceptions (such as tokenistic committee involvement) to deepen our understanding of public involvement processes and increase pro- gress towards more productive methods of public involvement. Oliver et al. (2008)\nA particularly fruitful method for involving the public in setting large-scale research agendas appears to be a combination of collaboration and consultation, with lay people taking leading roles in consulting their peers. Another advan- tage of our framework is that it exposes impor- tant gaps in the existing literature, most notably about methods for collective decision making,16 which are rarely reported in detail.@oliver2008multidimensional \nour framework was constructed from a combination of a priori issues, the information needs of the study set by the funders, and issues that emerged from the data. The dimensions of the framework emerged from our personal experience, from the back- ground methodological literature, and from the empirical or reflective reports that provided the ÔdataÕ of the review. As with much primary qualitative research, the framework was not identified until we were familiar with the literature as data, and it was instrumental in helping us code and organize the data, then describe and interpret the concepts. This approach allowed comparative analysis of varied and complex methods and the identification of gaps, whether these were gaps in individual reports (such as little description of methods, even less of public views and influence) or gaps in our collective knowledge, in particular, about methods for reaching decisions with patients ⁄publics. Oliver et al. (2008) \nOur framework allowed the abstract concept of empowerment to be addressed in very practical terms: the num- bers of people involved; whether they were individuals or networked group members. Oliver et al. (2008)\nIt is important to clearly establish the differences that distinguish an evolutionary process from another of change or transformation. Although these are related concepts in evolutionary theory, they actually denote different processes that act on different agents, which is why they tend to be confusing even among some specialists.\nEvolution is an overarching process that drives change in populations over generations. This means that evolutionary processes do not operate at the level of a specific individual or organism, which would only change or transform. Evolution therefore represents the cumulative effect of the inherited changes made by the characteristics of the individuals of a population, on which a selection process operates affecting the frequency of traits within a population over time. Change encompasses a broad spectrum of morphological or behavioral alterations within individuals from a variety of factors, including environmental pressures and reproductive patterns. Transformation suggests more profound or significant shifts in form, structure or function of individuals.\nThe idea of individualism is confronted with that of populationism. Darwin’s theory is a mix of both: natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism, regulating the frequencies of traits within a population over time. Populations are the units of evolution.\nAnother important approach to take into account is the one that confronts the idea of evolutionism with that of progressionism. The first refers to a change that is non-directional, while the second implies a direction in evolution, usually following a teleological change.\n\n\n\nFig1.

    "section": "4.2 Evolution",
    "text": "4.2 Evolution\nA simple evolutionary framework works like this:\nSudden or slow changes in the environment trigger a response in the organism that involves an adaptation, which means the loss, modification or creation of new individual traits. When the new traits are incorporated into the genetic variation of the population, the process of natural selection operates to favor some over others and derive a greater or lesser reproductive advantage to those individuals that have incorporated those new traits. This favoring or penalizing process carried out by the environment determines the greater or lesser ability of an organism to survive. This favoring or penalizing process carried out by the environment determines the greater or lesser ability of an organism to survive. At the end of the process the frequency of advantageous qualities (which are those that offer a greater ability to survive) will be higher, and those that offer less ability to survive have a lower frequency.\n\n\n\nFig2. Simple evolutionary framework\n\n\nIn the process of evolution is worth consider the role of feedback loops between mental an social evolution (as imagined by H.Spencer). For this author a more complex society is a stimulus for more mental development. This is the foundation of evolutionary psychology and of sociobiology.\nHow is the mechanism of evolution: cyclic vs. continuous?\nThe role of the organism to focus in new habits and become an active creative agent in charge of its own destiny is an idea of H.Spencer.This takes the evolutionary analyst to think about the role of knowledge and learning to change habits and create new instincts, in the end, to unfold a process of self-improvement (which is Lamarckian).\nStudy of the role of innovation and learning, and of free enterprise of individuals to cope with a competitive environment (H.Spencer). Linked to the above is also the discussion about the role of the government and the state as instruments that affect the environment.\n\n4.2.1 Competition\nThe evolutionary analyst must understand competition as that within an ecology based on struggle. These are three fundamental terms to understand the evolutionary analysis framework.\nIt is important to stop for a moment to understand the implications of the concept of ecology to explain an evolutionary system. To achieve this, a common approach has been to use biogeography as a way of knowing about the spread of relationships and how species compete to occupy territory.\n\n\n4.2.2 Convergent evolution (parallelism)\nThis conception of the evolutionary process implies the existence of a parallelism between independent evolutionary trajectories.\nThe environmental challenges over species A and B, make those species develop the sames structures and behaviors, which may have an impact on morphology, physiology, and life history traits. This continues forward with the same genetic pathways (even the same phenotypic traits), the consequence being on predictability/replicability of evolution, namely, the same solutions given to similar selective pressures.\nThis opens the debate between uniformitarianism (and graduation) vs catastrophism. The former is Lyell’s idea of the same processes of change today than ever. The later is about sudden changes, such as catastrophic events. ### Lamarckian approach The Lamarckian approach to evolution is based on the changes posed by the environment that determine (influence) the needs of organisms. These needs, when varying, affect the degree of use or disuse of certain organs (as is the case of a giraffe) and hence the greater or lesser development of certain parts of the body. This greater or lesser development of the parts of the body in turn affects the size and power of the organism’s organs and, ultimately, the organism’s ability to be preserved through reproduction.\n\n\n\nFig2. Lamarckian evolutionary framework\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Buffon’s perfect adapted organism\nAccording to this framework of thought, only when alterations in the environment occur, due to alterations in climate or geography, do variations appear. This is the moment when natural selection operates to adapt the species to new conditions.\nEnvironmental stressors cause the perfectly adapted organism to begin a process of degeneration and lose its original adaptability and perfection. This process that takes place over time gives rise to intermediate or transitional forms, which ultimately explain the diversity of life on earth.\n ### Spencer’s framework Herbert Spencer’s analytical framework establishes that new situations in the environment give rise to organisms having to learn how to cope with them. From this learning is derived the development of new instincts, which are more complex human faculties, which allow the organism to be more prepared to face the “survival of the fittest.”"

An analysis of the origin involves the need to explore for evidence of the past in search for a better system (what are the sources of evidence?).\nThe following are some of the theories to consider when addressing the problem of generation of the original structure:\n\nSpontaneous generation (often only for the simplest forms)\nPreformationism (forms that are predetermined)\nPre-existence\nA mold that is fixed.\n\nAfter the evidence of generation has become evident, the next step is to continue understanding the trend towards higher levels of complexity, and thee material forces that have an influence on the trend.\nWhen the evolutionary analyst deals with the problem of generation she must attend to the developmental process, and the constraints that it can impose on the rest of the evolutionary process. These constraints might introduce non-random variations, which can mean a way to direct. the course of evolution.\nIt is especially useful for the evolutionary analyst to consider that the unit (species) has a limited number of developmental pathways available and that the selection process would therefore be limited only to the possibility of tinkering with the details."

In the case of natural evolutionary theory, this unit has traditionally been the organism, but also the population and later, after modern synthesis, the gene. It is the analyst’s job to determine as clearly as possible which is the “unit” on which the evolutionary analysis of the system will focus.\nThinking about population opened the door to a statistical model of explanation, which is opposed to the Newtonian view of law-based causation.

The latter is a random process of a destructive-creative type, in which change occurs in discontinuous steps and not through a gradual modification. The above opens the debate over purposeful changes (goal directed with no fixed line of advance- H. Spencer). The “struggle for existence” (Malthus) and the “survival of the fittest” (spencer).\nOne result of this view is whether evolution is linear (represented by a ladder) vs a tree (the idea of branching).\n\n4.5.1 History\nThe system as the outcome of historical forces (Montesquieu).\nThe evolutionary analyst should elucidate whether the same forces of the past are those that govern the forces of today.\n…And the vision of progress with phases of equilibrium as the whole moved from homogeneity to heterogeneity (E.Tylor)\n(From Change) A good question to be reviewed by the evolutionary analyst: Is change a staged process, a process depending on historical forces?\n\n\n4.5.2 Forces\nIt is important when analyzing the environment to specify the type of force applied to the structure, and its sources in said environment.\nThe forces that operate to produce evolutionary changes can be:\n\nMutation\nNatural selection\nGenetic drift\n\nFollowing another typology of change forces (which should be clarified):\n\nHybridization\nRecombination\nSuperposition\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Selection\nIs (natural) selection an episodic or a continuous process?\nAre there periods of stable life where (natural) selection does not operate? or, Is (natural selection) always operating even in a stable environment?\nA related approach is the one which considers selectionism vs. saltationism, and the extension with the role of mass extinctions. This would open the debate about evolution not always being progressive, and the acceptance that species could degenerate in less challenging lifestyle.\nIs the (social) behavior programmed into us by natural selection? This would take us to the question of the development of social instincts.\nThe idea of struggle and death might have a positive purpose to keep species well adapted to a challenging environment (this is an utilitarian perspective). They might have a creative role (along with sex reproduction). Utilitarism in behavior and change/adaptation can be seen in J.S. Mill and W.Poley.\nHow evolution can produce advance in several directions (and not only towards humanity)?\nThe notion of selection used in this paper is that of having a balance between different characters within a population and not about the development of a murderous or aggressive instinct."

    "text": "4.7 Change\nBoth the structure and the behavior are permanently immersed in a process of change, since the unit is always sensitive to the forces exerted on it originating in the environment. The overall evolutionary process of the unit will depend on the way in which these forces affect the unit.\nThe characterization of the change process must be carried out considering the following key dimensions, all of them closely related:\n\nThe direction or trend of the change process. This question has historically been part of the discussion on evolutionary theory, with different approaches given by different authors.\nThe change driver, whether it is a single one or a set of drivers that configure the change process. This opens the debate between configurable versus non-configurable change or, in other words, whether change is manipulable (Lamarckian) or non-manipulable (Darwinian).\nThe mechanics of the process, whether gradual and slow, or sudden/abrupt and in jumps, or any intermediate alternative in the continuum formed by these two extremes.\nThe time scale on which the change process takes place. This can develop over a vast amount of time or a small amount of time, or somewhere in between.\nOpen-ended process based on trial-and-error vs. directed (fixed) process\n\nSome important considerations to keep in mind are that the process of change always implies progress, but it can also involve regression. Therefore, the evolutionary analyst faces both forward and backward movements.This goes hand in hand with the idea of continuous progress, as opposed to progress in jumps or saltation.\nA good question to be reviewed by the evolutionary analyst: Is change a staged process, a process depending on historical forces?\nWhat is the role of the state of technology to explain the change process, and that of diffusion of knowledge?\nBe aware that the process of accumulation of change can lead to the formation of new organs (new structure), according to E.Darwin.\n\n4.7.1 Mutations\nMutations play a role in the process of change, specifically they provide a source of random variation, but they do not generate new species. Mutations generate variation and natural selection then shapes the distribution of traits within a population over time.\nIt must be taken into account that not all genes that undergo a mutation produce drastic changes in the organism (individual); in reality, most mutations are neutral and do not produce noticeable changes. The evolutionary analyst will have to take into account that the environment plays a role in determining which mutated characters are those that spread in the population (this is nothing more than the phenomenon of selection).\nMaybe the concept of mutation is for more drastic transformations leading to new species, accepting that adaptation and selection might be irrelevant.\nCan the evolutionary analyst evaluate the idea that there might be internal forces generating characters unrelated to the organism’s needs? A related consideration may take us to consider that evolutionary changes occur in a predetermined manner driven by internal factors (this is called “directed evolution”). This is what has historically been called orthogenesis (F.Eimer).\nThe above opens involves fixity of direction, and if variation is also considered as not random, therefore there is no need for adaptation. According to this vision the environment would not have any role in evolution. Evolution might come to happen beyond what is functionally needed and not because environmental factors.\nDoes “overdevelopment theory” apply (A.Hyatt)?"

    "section": "4.8 Reproduction",
    "text": "4.8 Reproduction\nCurrently there is a generalized consensus in accepting the reproductive success of the unit as the main driver of selection, that is, the ability to transmit the genetic load of the unit to the offspring (this perspective has been criticised by Stephen Jay Gould). This modern vision of evolution has not always been like this, so less than 100 years ago success was considered to be found in the ability to adapt to the environment.\nSelection based on reproductive success has opened the doors to new avenues of interest and study, which now focus more on sexual selection, in the case of natural systems, or on the reproduction mechanisms of any other system. An interesting factor that every evolutionary analyst may want to analyze is the role of geographic barriers to explain the way in which species multiply.\nLet us also think that the selection process that takes place in the environment is continuous and is not interrupted even when the environment is stable. In other words, competition between some units and others for scarce resources never stops, even if the environment appears stable. The analogy of the Red Queen hypothesis, introduced by Van Halen Van Valen (2014) to denote that in the evolutionary race between organisms species must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their relative fitness within an ever-changing environment, it is good to explain that units must remain constantly improving or, otherwise, they will be outstripped by their rivals.\n\n4.8.1 Reproductive strategies\nWhat are the reproductive strategies in a population? There are a few: parthenogensis, hermaphroditism, R-selected, K-selected, Sewel parity, itero parity, mono/poly gams, hybridization, transmutation, pangenesis, orthogenesis.\nGerm (hard heredity) vs somato plasm (soft heredity).\n\n\n4.8.2 Developmental constraints\nThe concept of developmental constraints affects in shaping the course of evolution. This is because the embryonic development process imposes a series of limitations on the types of changes that can occur in organisms over time. Patterns and constraints of embryonic development can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary change and diversification.\n\n\n4.8.3 Evo-devo approach\nThis approach, abandoned by current biologists, states that “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”. To understand it we must apply an “evo-devo” approach, meaning that embryological processes are part of evolutionary systems. This approach presents the idea of “blending” as the most convincing explanation of reproduction.\nThe “evo-devo” approach is based on Von Baer’s laws of embryology, which establish the following:\n\nThe basic structures of the body are established before specialized features appear\nEmbryos progress from general to specific characteristics as they develop\n\nHomology vs analogy. These concepts establish that similar structures in different organisms are derived from a common ancestor.\nIn the case of homology a common ancestor “A” gives rise to a divergent pattern of species “B” and “C” that are specialized and have a different formation.\nThe pattern in the case of analogy is convergent, since two species “A” and “B” present the same organ with the same function.\n\n\n4.8.4 Speciation and Specialization\nThe problem of speciation, that is, the division of a parent into several descendants. This is related to niche specialization and adaptation. Speciation is a fundamental mechanism of biological diversification.\nSpeciation leads to opportunities for specialization. Specialization within populations can contribute to reproductive isolation and promote speciation. It can also drive specialized traits that lead to divergence of populations over time.\nIn specialization a constant force, natural selection, determines the level of specialization, posing a pressure to specialize on species (in line with Adam Smith thought). The level of specialization influences the level of adaptation, which drives a divergent process of speciation.\nTypes of specialization: genetic, behavioral or ecological.\nRole of geographical isolation of speciation There are two considerations in regards of the role of geographical isolation for speciation. One considers that specialization emerges without the need of geographical barriers, this is called sympatric speciation and is a radiply evolving type of speciation. Whereas allopatric speciation is much less rapid and more accepted today, and considers geographical barriers at the initial stage of species separation."

    "section": "5.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method",
    "text": "5.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method\nThere are arguments about whether it is feasible or acceptable to conduct syntheses of qualitative evidence at all,41 and whether it is acceptable to synthesise qualitative studies derived from different traditions. The distinctions, tensions and conflicts between these have been vividly described.@dixon2005synthesising\nPerhaps even more likely to generate controversy are attempts to synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence. It is evident from the discussion above that synthesis of diverse forms of evidence will generally involve conversion of qualitative data into quantitative form or vice versa. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nShould reviews start with a well-defined question and how many papers are required? The issue of questions is an important one for syntheses. It will be clear that the methods described above will be more suited to some questions than others: for example questions concerning causality may be better suited to qualitative comparative analysis than questions concerned with the production of mid-range theory, which might be better suited to meta-ethnography. The issue of how questions should be identified and formulated in the first instance is one on which there is much uncertainty.\nEstabrooks et al, like many in the systematic review community, argue that review questions should be selected to focus on similar populations or themes.43 However, others point out that in primary qualitative research, definitions of the phenomenon emerge from the data.15 Whether one should start with an a priori definition of the phenomenon for purposes of a secondary synthesis is therefore an important question.@dixon2005synthesising\nA related issue is how to limit the number of papers included in the review. One approach is to narrow the focus. An alternative strategy is offered by theoretical sampling, used in primary qualitative research with a view towards the evolving development of the concepts. Sampling continues until theoretical saturation is reached, where no new relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category, either to extend or contradict it.45 It has been suggested that this approach would also be suitable for selecting papers for inclusion in reviews.46–48 However, the application of this form of sampling has been rarely tested empirically, and some express anxiety that this may result in the omission of relevant data, thus limiting the understanding of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nAppraising studies for inclusion The issue of how or whether to appraise qualitative papers for inclusion in a review has received a great deal of attention. The NHS CRD guidance emphasises the need for a structured approach to quality assessment for qualitative studies to be included in reviews, but also recognises the difficulties of achieving consensus on the criteria that might constitute quality standards.5 Some argue that weak papers should be excluded. Others, however, propose that papers should not be excluded for reasons of quality, particularly where this might result in synthesisers discounting important studies for the sake of ‘surface mistakes’, which are distinguished from fatal mistakes that invalidate the finding.Published examples include reviews that have chosen not to appraise the papers,14 as well as those which have opted to appraise the papers using a formalised approach.22 If the argument prevails that some quality appraisal is necessary, the problem then arises as to how this should be undertaken. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nConclusions There is an urgent need for rigorous methods for synthesising evidence of diverse types generated by diverse methodologies. These methods are required to meet the needs of policy-makers and practitioners, who need to be able to benefit from the range of evidence available. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)"

    "section": "5.5 Practical Implications",
    "text": "5.5 Practical Implications\n\n5.5.1 Evolutionary analyst\nOne of the practical benefits derived from the present proposal of formulating an evolutionary systems analytical framework is to determine the need to have professionals with an evolutionary analyst profile. An evolutionary analyst is understood to be an academic or professional who has a clear and deep understanding of the evolutionary functioning of systems and who is capable of using rigorous analysis and tools to determine the factors that explain their essence and elements of change.\n\n\n5.5.2 Prediction ability\nIf we are able to acquire a deep understanding of the functioning of the evolutionary system, its components, behaviors and flow of changes, we can then better foresee in which direction the evolutionary system is moving and glimpse whether the system has the capacity to survive or, on the contrary, is doomed to disappearance.\nIt is worth considering the possibility of whether, based on increasingly deeper knowledge of the evolution of a system, it would be possible to act on the future of the system. In other words, if it could be feasible to design your own plan and carry it out based on the knowledge generated about the evolution of the system.\nTo what extent is the system under observation random in change or does it evidence a logic that can be known and even altered based on our desires or needs?\n\n\n5.5.3 Manipulation of the system and its programmability\nIf they were really able to manipulate the system as we wish, on what elements would it be most feasible to do so? Would it be possible to act on both the structural and behavioral elements, only on one of them? Being able to act on a known evolutionary system would open new and great opportunities to design systems that meet a wide diversity of needs.\nThe above would necessarily entail having to assess the ethical problems of altering the course of nature and the new problems that would emerge by distorting the natural mechanisms of the functioning of life and society. The opposite position would be to conclude that the system is unalterable and we cannot intelligently design it to satisfy our desires.\nSociety would go from a stage in which social systems are considered elusive to another in which we would be able to know to what extent their evolution is random, to what extent there is causality and to what extent they are programmable.\n\n\n5.5.4 Inform and activate policies\nAn evolutionary analysis framework can serve to inform who cannot support themselves, namely, who is more likely to survive and continue competitive, and who is threatened by disappearance.\nIdentifying who dominates over whom, that is, elucidating the relationships and power structures has great significance, but it is also a way to understand how species advance. In fact, the process of replacement or extinction of species is an essential aspect to understand human progress.\nThe level at which the analyst expects to inform policy, or the level of contribution expected by decision makers from an evolutionary model, is a factor in determining the level of analysis to be used in the “struggle for existence.”\nAdditionally, if education (education policies) could improve individuals, the benefits could perhaps be passed on through inheritance (this is a Lamarckian view).\n\n\n5.5.5 Overcoming the barriers that prevent systematic struggle\nFrom the RQs: Another question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual permits the struggle to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.\nThis leads us to the recommendation, in some circumstances mediated by policies, that the struggle does not have constraints that condition it. Thus, as the environment continues to pose challenges that must be faced (resolved) by the individual, progress will continues.\n\n\n5.5.6 Eugenics of individuals\nThe above leads us to the problem of eugenics, and the reflection on to what extent the system must ensure that the selection produces and there are no barriers for it to unfold its effects.\n\n\n5.5.7 The connection with complex systems\nThe analysis of evolutionary systems demonstrates a connection with complex systems, such that species should be seen as complex systems with an enormous amount of variation, stimulated by selection.\n\n\n5.5.8 The contribution of this review to policy\nThe key message from this systematic review is that interventions will not work unless public views about the value, safety, benefits and costs of walking and cycling are taken into account. This information will thus be of interest to parents and children, government policy-makers at the national and local level, schools, and research funding bodies. Policy-makers need to understand that perceived safety is a key influence on walking and cycling, but that environmental improvements and facilities can encourage a shift away from car culture.@brunton2006synthesis"

    "section": "5.6 Framework Thematic Discussion",
    "text": "5.6 Framework Thematic Discussion\n\n5.6.1 On Evolution\nWhen addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what the unit of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied. This is a discussion that has changed over time, having moved from the individual organism to what is currently considered a more correct approach, the gene. What the above means is that instead of prioritizing “adaptive fitness” in the analysis, today it seems more appropriate to focus on the reproductive success of the individual. This new perspective has given rise to the movement of ultra-Darwinism.\nThe analysis of evolutionary stratigraphy, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.\nThe geological law of superposition, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.\n\n5.6.1.1 Hierarchy\nThe idea of hierarchy involves something on top down to somethinge else.\nOnce the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the hierarchical structure of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.\n\n\n5.6.1.2 Classification\nA classification or taxonomy is a procedure used to better understand the diversity (and variation) of organisms.\nWhen studying the evolution of a population, building a classification or taxonomy of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through.\nWith a classification or taxonomy the analyst can study the diversity of the units (species) based e.g. in their morphology, as well as the ecological relationships that exist between them.\nIn the history of evolution, three major frameworks for classifying species are usually proposed:\n\nChain of being (Bonnet) -&gt; it is a hierarchical chain of relationships\nThe rope of being (Rubinet)\nLineo taxonomy based on visible resemblances (with no hierarchy)\n\n\n\n5.6.1.3 Miscelaneous\nThe idea of the extent to which the history of “life” has been progressive but in an irregular way.\nThe idea of “emergent evolution” (Lloyd Morgan) which highlights the new high-level properties that appear as evolution reaches a certain level of complexity.\n\n\n\n5.6.2 On the Origin\nThe idea of the Origin is consubstantially associated with the idea of an end, since everything that begins must necessarily have an end.\nThe problem of origin is closed related to the problem of generation, thus the evolutionary analyst must elucidate whether the origin of the unit is spontaneous, preformationist, etc.\nAn alternative perspective to the problem of origin can be raised from biogenesis (life arising from non-living matter) and the “primordial soup” (Opsin), that is, the combination of elements that gives rise to the synthesis of compounds ” organic” after adding energy to the system (from lightning, UVA radiation, volcanic activity, etc.)\n\n\n5.6.3 On the Environment\n\n5.6.3.1 On the Forces\nWe do not know the forces (and their sources) that operate driving the process of change in the individuals of a population.\nApart from the forces that operate at the level of individuals, it is necessary to know what the transmission mechanisms are like from the environment to the individual, between individuals, and vice versa, from the individual to the environment.\nWhat is the materiality of the pressure for change exerted by an environmental force?\n\n\n5.6.3.2 On Selection\nOne of the most difficult questions that every evolutionary analyst must face is how the selection process imposed by the environment actually work, and to what extent different alternative selection approaches can help explain the evolutionary course of the system.\nWe refer to the selection process not as the blind application of a closed paradigm that we know a priori will provide an explanatory response to the evolution of any system, but rather the analyst evaluates to what degree alternative selection models can provide insight into our understanding of the evolution of the system. It is about better understanding how rival visions can have a place in our understanding of the evolutionary phenomena of the system, even in an open and simultaneous way.\n\n\n\n5.6.4 On the Unit\n\n5.6.4.1 On the Structure\n\n\n5.6.4.2 On the Behavior\nTo what extent is the system’s behavior governed by inherited instincts? And to what extent can the selection process alter instincts? Are instincts constraints to the development of behavior and the process of change, or are they not such constraints?\nWhat behavioral traits can be considered innate and which are constructed with the interaction with the natural and social environment? What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?\nPerhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.\nCan individual behavior be predicted? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.\nTo what extent can learning and technology affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?\nThe problem of hierarchy can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g. intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?\nIt is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to control genes and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)\n\n\n\n5.6.5 On Change\nWe know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the historical past as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.\nIf change does not leave any proof (of evolution), why don’t we seek indirect progress (i.e. the equivalent of fossils)?\nIt is necessary to know which components of the individual’s structure (or flows) the forces of the environment act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.\nAlso relevant is the question of how the development process of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.\nDoes the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any goal or objective? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual’s process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g. a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?\nIn the analysis of evolutionary dynamics, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.\nWhat are the change mechanisms used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:\n\nHybridization\nRecombination\netc.\n\nTo what extent is the timeline for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.\nSpeaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary “clock” of the system. The idea of the clock is to explain traits that evolve at a constant rate overtime, due to underlying molecular mechanisms. In other words, that would explain the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time.\nIt is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.\nA possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as punctuated equilibria”. According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis.\nThe evolutionary analyst should open to the notion of arrow of time, and the preferred direction or sequence of change. And if the change process is reversible vs irreversible (with higher entropy). In turn, this should lead the analyst to consider the predictability or unpredictability of evolution.\nIs the result of evolution the same system of a new one?\n\n\n5.6.6 On Heredity\nWhat are the limits of heredity (change)?\n\n\n\n\nBrunton, Ginny, Sandy Oliver, Kathryn Oliver, and Theo Lorenc. 2006. “A Synthesis of Research Addressing Children’s, Young People’s and Parents Views of Walking and Cycling for Transport.”\n\n\nDixon-Woods, Mary, Shona Agarwal, David Jones, Bridget Young, and Alex Sutton. 2005. “Synthesising Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence: A Review of Possible Methods.” Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 10 (1): 45–53.\n\n\nOliver, Sandy R, Rebecca W Rees, Lorna Clarke-Jones, Ruairidh Milne, Ann R Oakley, John Gabbay, Ken Stein, Phyll Buchanan, and Gill Gyte. 2008. “A Multidimensional Conceptual Framework for Analysing Public Involvement in Health Services Research.” Health Expectations 11 (1): 72–84.\n\n\nWaters, Lea, and Daniel Loton. 2019. “SEARCH: A Meta-Framework and Review of the Field of Positive Education.” International Journal of Applied Positive Psychology 4: 1–46."
