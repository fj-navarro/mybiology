    "text": "1.1 Individual vs system decisions\nAlchian (1950) proposes an alternative method to solve this whole problem. It consists of treating decisions and selection criteria at the level of the economic system as more important than those made by individuals within it. This allows us to look at the interrelationship that exists between the environment and the individual behaviors that arise as a consequence of a process of natural selection.\nThe decision criterion in the firm’s behavior is now the realization of profits, which in turn acts as a (natural) selection mechanism that allows some firms to survive while others disappear. This decision and selection process takes place in impersonal markets, which are completely separate from individual decisions, from the capabilities and motivations of the units that decide, and even from their awareness of the functioning of this criterion. Simply realizing positive profits is enough to make a firm survive, no matter how, who or why it is achieved.\nAlchian (1950) recognizes that the realization of positive benefits may go to the most daring or lucky, not necessarily to those who are best prepared or carry out a process of strong reasoning, preparation and execution. Therefore, a specific motivation is not strictly necessary for the firm to survive, since “as in a race, the award goes to the relatively fastest, even if all the competitors loaf”."

    "section": "1.2 Adoption Behavior: Chance and Luck as a means for success",
    "text": "1.2 Adoption Behavior: Chance and Luck as a means for success\nLuck and chance can act in two ways: first when choosing an action to apply and its viability to realize benefits, second when deciding on a specific method of adaptation to a particular environment (Alchian 1950).\nIn this discussion, the debate arises about to what extent it is the survivor who manages to adapt to the environment, or whether it is the environment that actually adopts the survivor. In the first case, the adaptation process is something conscious. In the second, the survivor does not carry out any motivated or conscious process of change in search of adaptation, but rather it is the environment that adopts him.\nIn reality, it is the environment that determines the possible paths to success, or in other words, the path that a survivor must follow to become one. These paths are constantly changing, and what at a given moment in time made some individuals successful and others not, some time later it will make those who were previously unlucky now successful and able to survive (Alchian 1950).\nIn the context of adoption by the environment, the individual doesn’t really need to do anything, other than want to play this game (that is, making a decision when it is necessary to make it). According to Alchian himself, this somewhat random behavior that individuals may have does not eliminate the possibility that the decision made by one of them is appropriate for survival. Additionally, individual behavior resulting from motivation and foresight is always different from one individual to another, and if the pattern of all individuals is observed in aggregate, it is not very different from a random distribution of actions.\nA model dominated by chance also does not mean that it cannot be analyzed, explained and diagnosed by an economist. The economist can explain what types of behaviors are more likely to lead a firm to survive compared to others if he knows what the requirements for survival are, and without firms having to know what these requirements are, even more so if the objective is to explain what happened in the past rather than making a prediction. “The essential point is that individual motivation and foresight, while sufficient, are not necessary” (Alchian 1950).\nWith regards to the methods of analysis that can be used by economists, the analyst will only need some circumstances (economic environment) and some participants (firms) to diagnose the conditions under which they will be most likely to be successful."

    "text": "1.3 Adaptive Behavior: Imitation and Trial and Error\nEverything said above does not mean that firms do not act with foresight and purpose-oriented motivations. In reality, Alchian’s proposal is made up of both elements, the random and the purposeful. “The pursuit of profits, and not some hypothetical undefinable perfect situation, is the relevant objective whose fulfilment is rewarded with survival” (Alchian 1950).\nThat said, aiming to realize positive profits does not mean that it is easier to conclude about how firms can adopt actions that realize profits. This is a very high goal too. The existence of uncertainty diverts any effort to successfully conclude what the recipe for success is.\nAdaptive firm behavior occurs in two ways: by imitating the things that work in successful companies (so that those who imitate them can quickly implement them and achieve success more quickly) and by trial and error. This is what Alchian calls “codified imitations of observed success” (Alchian 1950). This type of behavior relieves the need to make decisions and make conscious innovations.\nThe second type of adaptive behavior pointed out by Alchian is trial and error. Some authors consider that through the firm’s adoption of various appropiate actions the trend is the convergence to a “profit maximization” equilibrium. However, in a changing environment, this is simply not possible since the comparability of resulting situations is destroyed. Trial-and-error is simply survival or death, but not the basis for a profit-maximization method of analysis."

Most conventional economic tools and concepts are still useful, although in a vastly different analytical framework-one which is closely akin to the theory of biological evolution” (Alchian 1950).\n“The economic counterparts of genetic heredity, mutations, and natural selection are imitation, innovation, and positive profit” (Alchian 1950).\n“The formalization of this approach awaits the marriage of the theory of stochastic processes and economics-two fields of thought admirably suited for union” (Alchian 1950)."

There is much evidence for believing that these two probabilities are related” (Alchian 1950).\n“In summary, I have asserted that the economist, using the present analytical tools developed in the analysis of the firm under certainty, can predict the more adoptable or viable types of economic interrelationships that will be induced by environmental change even if individuals are unable to ascertain them” (Alchian 1950).\n“Like the biologist, the economist predicts the effects of environmental changes on the surviving class of living organisms; the economist need not assume that each participant is aware of, or acts according to, his cost and demand situation” (Alchian 1950).\n\n\n\n\nAlchian, Armen A. 1950. “Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory.” Journal of Political Economy 58 (3): 211–21.\n\n\nRobinson, Joan. 1969.

    "text": "Alchian (1950) submits that there is a double reason to ask for a new economic analysis. These are an incomplete information in the functioning of the economic system and uncertain foresight. The latter recognizes the role of prediction that every economic analysis must play if it’s to be good.\nThis vision proposed by Alchian in 1954 moves away from the typical axiom of “profit maximization” and the prediction of the individual behavior of the firm as primary means for understanding the behavior of the firm. Instead, Alchian provides a solution by suggesting the adoption of biological evolution and natural selection as thinking paradigms. The introduction of this new approach allows Alchian to treat an economic system as an adaptive “mechanism” able to choose among those “(…) exploratory actions generated by the adaptive pursuit of”success” or “profits”.”\nA valuable benefit of this new perspective is that economic analysts can, according to Alchian, now confront problems that were previously considered aberrant or that required an ad-hoc analytical apparatus.Ultimately, it is an approach that widens the capabilities of economic analysis and prevents the analyst from having to introduce unrealistic assumptions to reach any coherent result.\nHowever, Alchian’s innovative approach remains half-finished because he assumes that he will continue using the same conceptual apparatus of his analytical predecessors. That is to say, the same concepts used in the type of analysis based on profit maximization seem to continue serving under its new perspective.\n\n\n\n\nAlchian, Armen A. 1950. “Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory.” Journal of Political Economy 58 (3): 211–21."

    "text": "3.1 Why Analogies?\n“The purpose of analogical reasoning in which we consciously and systematically apply the explanation of one series of events to another very different series of events is to help us better to understand the nature of the latter, which presumably is less well understood than the former. If the analogy has really helpful explanatory value, there must be some reason for believing that the two series of events have enough in common for the explanation of one, mutatis mutandis, to provide at least a partial explanation of the other. This type of analogy must be distinguished from the purely metaphorical analogy in which the resemblances between two phenomena are used to add a picturesque note to an otherwise dull analysis and to help a reader to see more clearly the outlines of a process being described by enabling him to draw on what he knows in order to imagine the unknown. Analogies of this sort are not only useful but almost indispensable to human thought.The biological analogies of the firm are not of this metaphorical type or there would be no call to push them into service to help explain the development of firms” (Penrose 1952)\n“In the notion that a firm is an organism akin to biological organisms, there is an implication that, since all such organisms have something in common, we can use our knowledge of biological organisms to gain more insight into the firm” (Penrose 1952)\n“Clearly the one thing a firm does not have in common with biological organisms is a genetic constitution, and yet this is the one factor that determines the life cycle of biological organisms.” (Penrose 1952) In this regard, see the use of the genetic analogy with Nelson and Winter’s (nelson1985evolutionary?) statement about what constitutes the genetic basis of the firm by assimilating it to the skills and abilities they have and that are transmitted from one employee to another."

    "text": "3.2 Main Types of Biological Analogies\n“Biological analogies in particular have been widely used in discussions of the firm. Probably the best known and most common of these analogies is that of the life cycle, in which the appearance, growth and disappearance of firms is likened to the processes of birth, growth, and death of biological organisms. Marshall’s reference to the rise and fall of the trees in the forest is an oft-quoted example of this type of analogy.” (Penrose 1952)\n“Recently, two additional biological analogies have been presented -a natural selection analogy, dubbed by one writer viability analysis, and the homeostasis analogy designed to explain some aspects of the behavior of firms. The former, like the life cycle analogy, is for use in long-run analysis only. The latter is exclusively for short-run analyIn summary, this book has no content whatsoever. Both are supposed to represent improvements on the existing theory of the firm at the core of which lies the chief target of attack - the assumption that firms attempt to maximize profit” (Penrose 1952)\n“The chief danger of carrying sweeping analogies very far is that the problems they are designed to illuminate become framed in such a special way that significant matters are frequently inadvertently obscured. Biological analogies contribute little either to the theory of price or to the theory of growth and development of firms and in general tend to confuse the nature of the important issues.” (Penrose 1952)"

    "text": "3.3 The “Life Cycle” Theory of the Firm (Kenneth Boulding)\n“Implicit in the notion that firms have a”life cycle” analogous to that of living organisms is the idea that there are “laws” governing the development of firms akin to the laws of nature in accordance with which living organisms appear to grow, and that the different stages of development are a function of age.” (Penrose 1952)\n“The purposes a life cycle theory of the firm would serve are obvious, yet the theory as a bare undeveloped hypothesis has existed for a long time and nothing has been done to construct from it a consistent theoretical system with sufficient content to enable it to be used for any purpose whatsoever. The basic hypothesis is not one from which sig- nificant logical consequences can be deduced, such as can be deduced,’ for example, from the proposition that firms attempt to maximize prof- its. Supplementary hypotheses about the kind of organism the firm is and the nature of its life cycle are required. Although we have a re- spectable collection of information about firms, it has not stimulated economists even to suggest the further hypotheses necessary to the de- velopment of a life cycle theory of the firm. This, I think, is primarily because the available evidence does not support the theory that firms have a life cycle characterized by a consistent transition through recog- nizable stages of development similar to those of living organisms. In- deed, just the opposite conclusion must be drawn: the development of firms does not proceed according to the same”grim” laws as does that of living organisms. In the face of the evidence one is led to wonder why the analogy persists and why there is still a demand for a life cycle theory of the firm” (Penrose 1952).\n\n\n\n\nPenrose, Edith Tilton. 1952. “Biological Analogies in the Theory of the Firm.” The American Economic Review 42 (5): 804–19."
