    "text": "Alchian determines that there is a double reason to ask for a new economic analysis. These are an incomplete information in the functioning of the economic system and a uncertain foresight. The latter recognizes the role of prediction that every economic analysis must play if it’s to be good.\nThe solution provided by Alchian to solve this needs of the economic analysis is to revert to biological evolution and natural selection. The recourse to this perspective allow him to introduce the idea of “adoptive mechanism” as a means to interpret the economic system as one “(…)which chooses among exploratory actions generated by the adaptive pursuit of”success” or “profits”.”"
