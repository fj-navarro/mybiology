    "title": "Towards an Integrative Meta-Framework for the Evolutionary Analysis of the Firm",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nEvolutionary economics, especially in its endeavor to elucidate the behavior of firms, confronts notable integrative challenges that have constrained its ascension as a mainstream alternative within economics vis-à-vis classical paradigms. Central among these challenges are the dispersion, fragmentation, and reductionism inherent in the accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, the integration of evolutionary knowledge stands as a main driver for disciplinary advancement, offering a pathway to holistic comprehension, innovation stimulation, methodological enhancement, and improved applicability in policy and practice domains. In response to these impediments, a meta-framework for knowledge integration has been formulated. Rooted in foundational tenets derived from evolutionary biology, evolutionary economics, and firm-specific research, this integrated approach seeks to furnish deeper insights into the complex dynamics governing firms, while providing a more cohesive and structured comprehension of firm evolution by transcending disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this meta-framework for scholarly inquiry and practical application, while identifying prospective avenues for future research.\nKeywords: Evolutionary economics, Meta-framework, Firm behavior, Knowledge Integration."

    "text": "Evolutionary studies have greatly enhanced our comprehension of fundamental natural and social phenomena, spanning from biological evolution to cultural and societal changes. Originating from humanity’s enduring quest to understand life’s origins and development, the notion of evolution can be traced to the intellectual explorations of early civilizations in antiquity. Early inklings of transformation of species over time appear in the works of philosophers Anaximander and Empedocles, dating back to the 6th century BC. Nonetheless, it wasn’t until the 19th century that evolutionary thought began to crystallize into a formal scientific discipline.\nCharles Darwin’s seminal work “On the Origin of Species” (1859) laid the foundation for modern evolutionary theory. Darwin proposed the mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind evolution, whereby organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to subsequent generations. This revolutionary idea sparked intense debate and controversy during and after Darwin’s own life, challenging traditional religious and philosophical beliefs about the origins of life. Notwithstanding, evolutionary thought did not solely stem from the contributions of a single man. While Darwin’s work catalyzed the formalization of evolutionary theory, its development was the result of a rich tradition and the convergence of multiple disciplines shaped by a diverse array of thinkers spanning various fields.\nEarly scholars in the tradition of evolutionary thought commonly explored patterns of change and adaptation across biological, cultural, and social contexts. Anthropologists like Herbert Spencer and Lewis Henry Morgan explored the evolution of human societies and cultures, laying the groundwork for the field of cultural evolution. Likewise, sociologists such as Émile Durkheim and Max Weber investigated social change and the evolution of institutions within societies. Moreover, the interdisciplinary character of evolutionary thought became apparent as it began incorporating insights from more diverse fields, including psychology, archaeology, and linguistics. Each discipline provided distinctive perspectives on the mechanisms and processes of change, thereby enhancing our comprehension of evolution in its widest scope.\nEvolutionary economics, akin to other evolutionary branches in the social sciences, aligned with tradition by applying principles of variation, selection, and adaptation to economic dynamics. Pioneering economists like Thorstein Veblen and Joseph Schumpeter drew parallels between biological evolution and economic processes, emphasizing innovation, competition, and adaptation’s role. The evolutionary theory of the firm, introduced in 1980 by Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter, deepened this connection. They advocated for examining firm behavior and organizational change through the lens of principles such as variation, selection, and retention. Their approach underscored the importance of routines, capabilities, and organizational learning in shaping the evolution of firms. Additionally, evolutionary economics acknowledged historical contingency and path dependence’s importance in shaping economic outcomes. Such a perspective underscored that current economic systems result from cumulative historical processes, with past events exerting lasting influence.\nAs evolutionary theory continued to progress, shedding light on a myriad of phenomena from the origins of life to the behaviors of organisms and human societies, its potential as an integrative framework and alternative to classical thought remains unrealized. This is especially evident in evolutionary economics, where despite continuous efforts to integrate evolutionary principles into economic theory, the field remains on the periphery of the economics profession, largely overshadowed by the dominance of neoclassical models in mainstream economics. An important critique concerns perceived deficiencies in formalization and integration within the field. Furthermore, evolutionary economics confronts contemporary challenges, including those stemming from technological advances, environmental sustainability concerns, and geoeconomic disparities. These challenges are amplified by increasing demands for evolutionary economic principles to inform policy responses to disruptive changes, thereby intensifying scrutiny of the field’s efficacy in addressing a wide array of issues, including innovation policies, industrial strategies, and environmental regulations.\nThis article is an attempt to push for the advancement in the formalization and integration of evolutionary thinking in the studies of the firm as a living organism and its behavior. Through the construction of a meta-framework, this research aims to consolidate the essential structural components together with their interrelationships of a evolutionary analytical framework of the firm. This effort is intended to contribute to smooth the existing barriers that impede the effective utilization of evolutionary thinking by management scholars and practitioners. Ultimately, the goal is to enrich our comprehension of firms and their behavioral dynamics.\nThe subsequent sections fulfill distinct objectives to achieve this aim: Section 1 establishes the foundation by delineating the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and its integration into economics, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of evolutionary studies. Section 2: Summary of Weaknesses in the Literature identifies and discusses the main weaknesses in the existing literature pertaining to evolutionary analysis of firms, providing a critical overview of the current state of evolutionary economics research. Section 3: Description and Explanation of the Evolutionary Framework from Biology utilizes Bowler’s “Evolution” book as a reference to elucidate the components and main relationships of the evolutionary framework from biology, establishing the theoretical underpinnings for subsequent analysis. Section 4: Construction of a Meta-framework for the Evolutionary Analysis of the Firm proposes a meta-framework tailored to the analysis of firms, integrating insights from evolutionary economics and related fields to provide a comprehensive approach to studying firm behavior. Section 5: Discussion of the Main Consequences of the Meta-framework explores and discusses the implications of the proposed meta-framework for evolutionary analysis of firms, elucidating its potential contributions to scholarly inquiry and practical application. Section 6: Limitations and Future Lines of Research acknowledges the limitations of the research conducted and outlines potential avenues for future research in evolutionary economics and the analysis of firm behavior. Finally, Section 7: Conclusion offers a succinct summary of the main contributions of the paper, highlighting the significance of the proposed meta-framework and suggesting directions for further exploration in the field of evolutionary economics."

    "title": "2  Challenges in Integrating Evolutionary Knowledge",
    "section": "2.1 Dispersion",
    "text": "2.1 Dispersion\nKnowledge dispersion refers to the widespread distribution of information across diverse sources, disciplines, and domains. It reflects the multiplicity of perspectives, theories, and methodologies that exist within different areas of knowledge. Dispersion is evident in the varied insights found across numerous fields, publications, and researchers. Each discipline contributes its specialized knowledge, creating a rich tapestry of perspectives that enhances the overall understanding within the academic landscape. However, in such a dispersed environment, knowledge takes on different forms and becomes accessible primarily to individuals within specific fields, fostering information asymmetry between disciplines. Experts within their domains can readily access and utilize relevant knowledge, while those outside these fields often encounter barriers that hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange. Furthermore, dispersion promotes specialization within disciplines, as researchers focus deeply on narrow topics within their areas of expertise, further fragmenting knowledge into specialized subfields.\nIn the field of evolutionary thought, the dispersion of knowledge arises from a complex interplay of historical, interdisciplinary, and methodological factors, highlighting the diverse and multifaceted nature of evolutionary inquiry. Over time, evolutionary theory has given rise to various paradigms and theoretical frameworks, each reflecting different interpretations and emphases within the discipline. Interdisciplinary engagement has been central to this dispersion, intersecting with numerous fields such as biology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and economics. Each discipline approaches evolutionary phenomena from its unique perspective, leading to diverse interpretations and methodologies. Consequently, evolutionary insights become dispersed across disciplinary boundaries, reflecting the varied lenses through which scholars from different fields view evolutionary processes.\nThe broad applicability of evolutionary principles to diverse phenomena further contributes to this dispersion. From biological evolution to cultural dynamics and economic behavior, evolutionary concepts resonate across a wide array of domains, resulting in the dispersion of evolutionary insights across disparate fields of study. Methodological pluralism within evolutionary thought further amplifies this dispersion. Scholars employ a variety of empirical, qualitative, mathematical, computational, and comparative approaches to investigate evolutionary processes, each yielding unique insights and perspectives. These methodological preferences vary across disciplines and research traditions, creating a highly dispersed landscape of evolutionary inquiry."

    "title": "2  Challenges in Integrating Evolutionary Knowledge",
    "section": "2.2 Fragmentation",
    "text": "2.2 Fragmentation\nKnowledge fragmentation involves the compartmentalization and isolation of information into distinct fragments or disciplines, each characterized by specific boundaries and specialized focus areas. Fragmentation creates disciplinary silos where researchers operate within narrow domains of expertise and research, often with limited interaction or collaboration across fields. These silos are upheld by disciplinary boundaries that define the scope of each field and restrict the flow of information and ideas between disciplines. As a result, researchers within fragmented fields may adopt reductionist approaches, simplifying complex phenomena to fit within their disciplinary frameworks.\nThe impact of knowledge fragmentation can be profound, creating barriers to the integration and synthesis of knowledge across disciplines. By reinforcing disciplinary boundaries, fragmentation impedes interdisciplinary collaboration and hampers efforts to develop comprehensive, holistic understandings of complex phenomena. Moreover, fragmentation can lead to a narrow perspective among researchers, who may become entrenched in their disciplinary viewpoints and methodologies, potentially overlooking valuable insights from other fields. This narrow focus can result in duplicated efforts as researchers within fragmented disciplines inadvertently replicate studies or fail to consider relevant findings from complementary fields, resulting in inefficiencies and redundancy.\nThe fragmentation of evolutionary thought into disciplinary silos and compartments is driven by a combination of historical, methodological, and institutional factors that continue to influence the field today. These factors have significantly shaped the evolution and structure of evolutionary studies. Despite efforts to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and integration, disciplinary boundaries persist, often reinforced by institutional structures, funding mechanisms, and academic incentives. These boundaries limit the exchange of ideas and hinder the development of comprehensive, holistic understandings of evolutionary processes. For example, evolutionary economics and evolutionary biology often operate in separate academic spheres, with economists focusing on market dynamics, innovation, and firm behavior, while biologists concentrate on genetic and ecological aspects of evolution. This separation is maintained by distinct funding sources, specialized journals, and academic departments, which can discourage collaboration and the sharing of insights between these disciplines. As a result, important connections between biological evolution and economic behaviors may be overlooked or underexplored, such as how evolutionary principles can inform the understanding of market adaptations and organizational strategies. Overcoming these challenges requires dedicated efforts to break down interdisciplinary barriers, encourage collaboration among scholars from different disciplines, and integrate diverse perspectives within the field of evolutionary thought."

    "title": "2  Challenges in Integrating Evolutionary Knowledge",
    "section": "2.3 Reductionism",
    "text": "2.3 Reductionism\nReductionism involves dissecting complex phenomena into isolated components or subsystems, often at the expense of understanding the system as a whole and neglecting a holistic perspective. While this approach can yield valuable insights, it can also obscure the broader context and interconnections between different parts of a system. When scholars focus on isolated elements rather than the interactions and relationships among them, reductionism limits the scope of research and the potential for integrative theories and solutions.\nIn evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of the firm this reductionist tendency appears when scholars concentrate solely on specific aspects or subtopics without considering the interconnectedness and interdependencies within the broader evolutionary framework. For example, researchers might focus exclusively on technological innovation within firms, analyzing how specific advancements influence firm performance. While this focus is valuable, it may overlook the interactions between these innovations and other factors such as market conditions, regulatory environments, and organizational culture. Without considering these interactions, the analysis remains incomplete and potentially misses key insights into the firm’s overall evolutionary dynamics.\nThe risks associated with reductionist approaches are multifaceted. First, reductionism can result in a loss of context, where researchers fail to recognize the broader factors influencing economic evolution and firm behavior. By isolating specific components or mechanisms, scholars may overlook the environmental, social, and institutional dynamics that shape evolutionary processes within the economic landscape. Second, reductionism may fail to capture emergent properties inherent within complex economic systems. For instance, in evolutionary economics, interactions among diverse economic agents and institutions often give rise to emergent phenomena that cannot be understood by examining components in isolation. Failure to recognize and account for these emergent properties may lead to a limited understanding of economic evolution and dynamics.\nFurthermore, reductionism may impede the ability to effectively address complex problems. Many economic phenomena, including firm behavior and market dynamics, are inherently complex and multifaceted, requiring a holistic understanding to develop comprehensive solutions. Scholars using reductionist approaches often overlook the interconnections and interactions crucial for understanding complex systems, leading to incomplete or erroneous conclusions that fail to address the full scope of a problem. Ultimately, reductionist approaches that oversimplify these problems may result in inadequate policy prescriptions or managerial interventions that do not address their underlying complexity.\nReductionism can also impede interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge integration within evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of firms. Given the inherently interdisciplinary nature of these fields, effective research often necessitates integrating insights from diverse disciplines, including economics, biology, psychology, and sociology. Reductionist tendencies restrict researchers’ capacity to engage with broader interdisciplinary questions and inhibit the synthesis of knowledge across different domains. Consequently, this overspecialization may stifle the advancement of the discipline by limiting opportunities for innovation and the cross-fertilization of ideas."

    "title": "3  Why a Meta-Framework?",
    "section": "3.1 Rationale for Meta-Framework Development",
    "text": "3.1 Rationale for Meta-Framework Development\nThe rationale for constructing our meta-framework stems from the following considerations. Firstly, a meta-framework, essentially a synthesis of existing frameworks, offers a robust methodological approach to address the dispersed nature of knowledge on firm evolution. By integrating insights from evolutionary economics, organizational theory, and related disciplines, our meta-framework establishes a unifying structure that bridges diverse research strands related to firm behavior. This holistic perspective fills the gap between micro-level organizational dynamics and macro-level environmental influences. Given the inherent complexity of this field, a meta-framework serves as a powerful tool for scholars and practitioners. It empowers them to develop more effective strategies for managing organizational change, fostering innovation, and adapting to dynamic market environments, ultimately leading to significant benefits.\nSecondly, the meta-framework functions as a methodological bridge between theoretical concepts and empirical observations in evolutionary firm analysis. It provides a structured framework for organizing diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiries. This equips researchers with a standardized vocabulary of core concepts and essential terms necessary for constructing causal explanations. This systematic methodology fosters rigor and coherence in research endeavors, enabling clearer interpretations of empirical findings and propelling the advancement of theoretical developments concerning firm behavior.\nThirdly, the meta-framework facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing a shared language and conceptual framework for scholars and practitioners across diverse disciplinary backgrounds. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, the meta-framework encourages the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers, fostering innovative insights and perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly important for addressing complex research questions that necessitate multifaceted analyses drawing from multiple knowledge domains.\nFourth, the inherent step-by-step procedural method employed in constructing the meta-framework ensures a high level of transparency, thus allowing for a clear delineation of the systematic processes guiding data analysis, from descriptive elucidation to explanatory inference. This transparency extends to the researchers’ interpretative efforts, ensuring a traceable trajectory of analytical insights throughout any study related to firm behavior.\nFifth, unlike other qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, constructing a meta-framework adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby accommodation to a wider range of data types and research contexts (Goldsmith 2021; Gale et al. 2013). This flexibility is critical for our investigation, as we utilize primary and secondary data from both conceptual and empirical studies across the natural and social sciences. By integrating insights from diverse disciplinary domains, we aim to offer a comprehensive perspective, transcending disciplinary boundaries to gain a nuanced understanding of evolutionary firm dynamics.\nIn conclusion, the creation of a meta-framework represents a methodological innovation that aligns perfectly with the research objectives of this study. Our meta-framework offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to firm analysis, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, enhancing theoretical development, and ultimately contributing to the advancement of evolutionary economics.\n\n\n\n\nBinder, Claudia R, Jochen Hinkel, Pieter WG Bots, and Claudia Pahl-Wostl. 2013. “Comparison of Frameworks for Analyzing Social-Ecological Systems.” Ecology and Society 18 (4).\n\n\nCox, Michael, Sergio Villamayor-Tomas, Graham Epstein, Louisa Evans, Natalie C Ban, Forrest Fleischman, Mateja Nenadovic, and Gustavo Garcia-Lopez. 2016. “Synthesizing Theories of Natural Resource Management and Governance.” Global Environmental Change 39: 45–56.\n\n\nGale, Nicola K, Gemma Heath, Elaine Cameron, Sabina Rashid, and Sabi Redwood. 2013. “Using the Framework Method for the Analysis of Qualitative Data in Multi-Disciplinary Health Research.” BMC Medical Research Methodology 13 (1): 1–8.\n\n\nGoldsmith, Laurie J. 2021. “Using Framework Analysis in Applied Qualitative Research.” Qualitative Report 26 (6).\n\n\nMollinga, Peter P. 2008. “The Rational Organisation of Dissent: Boundary Concepts, Boundary Objects and Boundary Settings in the Interdisciplinary Study of Natural Resources Management.” ZEF working paper series.\n\n\nPartelow, Stefan. 2023. “What Is a Framework?

    "text": "4.1 Familiarization with Literature\nBefore delving into the detailed construction of our meta-framework, an exploratory review of the extant literature was conducted covering the fields of evolution in the natural sciences, evolutionary economics, evolutionary analysis of the firm, and related areas within the social sciences, including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science. The primary objective was to gather as many different and interdisciplinary perspectives as possible, identify knowledge gaps, grasp the current state of knowledge, and pinpoint the most pertinent theories, models, and existing related frameworks. By completing the familiarization step first, the meta-framework was built on a solid foundation of prior research, ensuring its alignment with established knowledge.\nDuring the familiarization step, priority was given to achieving a broad understanding of relevant topics, interdisciplinary connections, and the complexity of the study area, rather than conducting an exhaustive review of all studies available in the literature. To achieve this, the familiarization encompassed high-quality articles from major peer-reviewed databases, along with books and conference proceedings, and, though not comprehensive, effectively identified key themes, recurring patterns, and emerging controversies in the field of evolutionary analysis of the firm. This approach not only enabled the initial mapping of the intellectual landscape but also supported the formulation of the research questions and objectives. Furthermore, it provided valuable insights into the diverse perspectives and frameworks of the last two centuries in the field of evolutionary studies."

The process included the selection of a foundational or seminal work that comprehensively addressed the central ideas relevant to our research question. The selected work had to provide a robust theoretical and empirical basis for constructing a baseline meta-framework and serve as a reliable source for identifying the essential dimensions of evolution as a process. The seminal work chosen was from the field of evolutionary natural sciences, and the reasons were twofold. First, the work had a widespread recognition within the scientific community for its contributions to the understanding of natural evolution. Second, the work offered a valuable historical perspective on the trajectory of evolutionary thought, encompassing both mainstream and divergent ideas.\nAfter choosing the seminal work, a thorough review was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of its core arguments, methodologies, and conclusions. During this stage, the recurring themes, significant dimensions, and the relationships between the core themes were identified. This step was critical for capturing the structure of the ideas and their interconnectedness, forming the foundation of the a priori framework. The extracted information was then organized into thematic categories. These categories were carefully aligned with the research objectives and encompassed core themes that were directly relevant to the focus of the study, as well as peripheral themes that provided valuable context or supporting insights.\nAfter completing the categorization process, the a priori meta-framework was refined to better align its themes and relationships with the specific goals of the research. This approach ensured that the resulting a priori meta-framework was grounded in established knowledge and tailored to serve as a structured template for mapping and coding new data in subsequent stages of the meta-synthesis, thereby enhacing coherence and completeness throughout the process."

The first strand delved into the domain of evolutionary economics, with a particular focus on the analysis of firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. The second strand explored case studies that utilized evolutionary concepts and/or frameworks to investigate the dynamics of the firm. Each review employed a distinct search strategy to ensure methodological rigor and the identification of high-quality research. Both WOS and SCOPUS databases were targeted to maximize the rigor and quality of the search.\nThe first thematic review adopted a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant scholarship pertaining to the fundamental tenets and interconnected concepts that characterize the evolutionary view of the firm. To capture the broadest possible range of ideas and perspectives, the review employed broad search terms and an extensive time-frame. The second review focused on case studies that analyzed firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. This review encompassed articles that explicitly contained the term “evolution” and/or “evolutionary” in their titles and those that analyzed the behavior of the firm in an evolutionary way although they did not explicitly contained the term “evolution” or “evolutionary” in the title. To identify the latter, a qualitative research technique known as “pearl-growing” was employed. This technique metaphorically refers to the process of iteratively accumulating valuable “pearls” of information by expanding the search based on references, citations, or recommendations found in an initial set of identified sources. In our context, the “pearls” were found after the valuable insights gained from the references and citations included in the first systematic literature review."

First, a systematic data extraction process was undertaken that collected relevant information from the selected studies, including verbatim quotes and key findings supported by the study data. This allowed the capture of all information necessary to address the research questions, ultimately forming a robust empirical foundation for the construction of the meta-framework.\nAfter data extraction, all data were mapped and coded againts the a priori meta-framework established earlier. The process involved organizing the data in a meaningful manner to facilitate the identification of emerging patterns and relationships. Data coding was conducted thematically, adhering to the predefined themes identified within the a priori meta-framework, although the coding approach remained adaptable. Any relevant data that did not fit the themes of the a priori meta-framework were incorporated through an inductive approach. This allowed new themes and relationships to emerge from the data itself, ensuring the meta-analysis captured the full range of relevant information, even if it fell outside the a priori framework.\nTo enhance the rigor and efficiency of this process, qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti was employed. While Atlas.ti does not supplant the researcher’s critical role in data analysis and interpretation, it significantly bolsters the methodological rigor, efficiency, and overall quality of the research endeavor. Atlas.ti played a key role in streamlining data management and coding tasks while also facilitating visual analysis to identify patterns, themes, and relationships that might be less apparent through strictly textual methods."

This involved critical examination of the whole work, carefully evaluating each theme to ensure faithful representation of the data. As a result, the initial a priori meta-framework was further refined to achieve a more accurate reflection of the extracted data.\nSubsequently, the author interpreted the relationships between the themes, aiming to generate meaningful insights into how these themes interact and influence one another.

    "text": "5.3 The A Priori Meta-Framework\nUnlike traditional meta-framework synthesis approaches, which typically require extensive literature reviews, consultations, and deep topic expertise to develop an a priori framework, our approach focused on selecting a seminal work from the existing literature that thoroughly addressed the key concepts and relationships defining evolution in the natural sciences. This foundational work facilitated a more rapid and efficient coding and synthesis process, bypassing the need for extensive preparatory work. As a result, our approach offers a streamlined and effective method for conducting meta-framework synthesis, allowing for a stronger focus on the review process itself.\nThe selected work was Peter J. Bowler’s seminal book, “Evolution: The History of an Idea” (2009), which examines the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding the development of economic systems. Bowler’s interdisciplinary perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic processes, viewing them as evolving systems shaped by continuous change over time. His analysis offers valuable insights for evolutionary economics by uncovering the historical origins of evolutionary ideas and demonstrating their relevance to economic analysis.\nAnother key reason that explains why Bowler’s work is relevant to our research is its examination of the interplay between cultural, scientific, and anthropological factors in shaping evolutionary theories. Bowler traces the development of evolutionary thought from its origins in ancient Greece to its modern understanding, highlighting how societal beliefs and values influenced these concepts. This insight is particularly valuable for evolutionary economists, as it underscores the importance of understanding the cultural and ideological contexts in which economic systems emerge and evolve.\nBowler’s exploration of the contributions made by key figures to evolutionary thought is another significant contribution to our a priori meta-framework. He examines the ideas and theories of prominent thinkers, elucidating their influence on the development of evolutionary theory. Understanding this intellectual lineage provides our a priori meta-framework with insights into the historical roots of contemporary economic theories and methodologies. Bowler’s analysis also highlights the diversity of perspectives within evolutionary thought, enriching our meta-framework with a broad spectrum of ideas to draw upon in the analysis of evolutionary economic systems.\nAdditionally, Bowler’s book delves into the controversies and debates surrounding the concept of evolution, shedding light on the varying interpretations and contestations of evolutionary theory throughout history. This aspect is particularly relevant for constructing our a priori meta-framework, as it emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of economic evolution. By examining historical debates over evolutionary theory, our meta-framework gains a deeper appreciation for the contested nature of economic processes and the diverse array of factors that shape them. Bowler’s nuanced analysis encourages critical engagement with evolutionary concepts and methodologies, fostering a more robust and interdisciplinary approach to studying economic systems.\nIn conclusion, Bowler’s comprehensive treatise on evolution in natural science provides a robust foundation for delineating themes and aggregate dimensions, serving as a template against which to code the data extracted from the literature review on evolutionary economics and the evolutionary view of the firm conducted in subsequent stages of this research. Consequently, each theme within the a priori meta-framework encapsulates essential aspects of evolutionary theory, illuminating the intricate mechanisms governing evolution and evolutionary behavior. The resulting a priori meta-framework reflects the following key themes (Fig. 1):\n\n\n\nFig1. A priori meta-framework for evolutionary systems analysis. Source: own elaboration based on Bowler (2003)\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Unit of analysis\nIn the context of evolutionary studies, the unit of analysis refers to the fundamental entity upon which observations and analyses are focused. Historically, the choice of the unit of analysis has evolved. Initially, emphasis was placed on the organism, defined in biology as a unique living being—such as a plant, animal, or microorganism—capable of independent existence and reproduction. This focus later shifted to the population, and subsequently, following the modern synthesis, to the gene. Analysts must clearly identify the primary unit of evolutionary analysis within each system under study.\nDespite the shifts in the locus of analysis, the individual organism remains a cornerstone in evolutionary studies, representing a single, discrete entity within a given population. However, distinguishing between the individual organism and the population as units of analysis is crucial for any evolutionary study. The individual organism represents a single instance of life, while the population comprises a group of organisms of the same species occupying a defined geographical area and sharing genetic similarities. The individual organism serves as the building block of the population, with its traits, behaviors, and adaptations contributing to the collective dynamics of the population. This fundamental differentiation between individual and population units of analysis can be illustrated in Darwin’s theory, which encompasses both types of units. Natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism, influencing the frequencies of traits within a population over time.\nThe selection of a specific unit of analysis significantly influences the scope and focus of evolutionary approaches. Analyzing individual organisms allows researchers to examine specific traits, behaviors, and adaptations within a single entity, providing insights into microevolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. Conversely, studying populations enables researchers to investigate macroevolutionary patterns and trends, such as speciation and diversification, by considering the collective dynamics and genetic variability within and between populations. While the individual organism offers granularity in understanding the mechanisms of evolutionary change at a local level, the population provides a broader perspective on the dynamics of species evolution and adaptation over time. Both units of analysis are integral to comprehensively elucidating the complexities of evolution within natural systems. They highlight the interplay between individual-level characteristics and population-level dynamics in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species.\n\n\n5.3.2 Origin\nThe emergence of a population from individuals significantly shapes the evolutionary trajectory of the natural system. Therefore, investigating the origin of individuals is paramount in evolutionary analysis, as it addresses fundamental inquiries regarding the emergence, diversification, distribution, and persistence of life forms on Earth. This line of inquiry involves examining evidence from the past to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the origination and divergence of new species from common ancestors. Subsequently, attention shifts towards understanding the trend towards increased complexity and the underlying forces driving this evolutionary trend.\nThe concept of “origin” in evolutionary studies is closely intertwined with that of “generation” and “developmental processes”, collectively enhancing our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. While the study of “origin” focuses on the emergence of new species or lineages, marking the beginning of their subsequent evolutionary trajectory and setting the stage for evolutionary change within populations, the study of “generation” concerns the production of offspring or new individuals within a population. In essence, while the study of “origin” examines how new species arise and diverge from common ancestors, the study of “generation” delves into the mechanisms by which new individuals are generated and their contributions to genetic variation and evolutionary change within populations. Thus, an examination of reproductive processes and their impacts on population and species dynamics becomes essential.\nUltimately, “developmental” constraints also play a key role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of individuals and populations. Embryonic development imposes constraints on the types of changes organisms can undergo over time, highlighting the integral role of embryological processes within evolutionary systems. Exploring the patterns and constraints of embryonic development provides valuable insights into the mechanisms propelling evolutionary change and diversification in natural systems.\n\n\n5.3.3 Evolutionary vs Change process\nEvolutionary processes involve dynamic mechanisms that drive changes at the population level across successive generations. Instead of acting solely on individual organisms, these mechanisms accumulate inherited changes within populations. Studying evolution at the population level provides insights into broad patterns of genetic variation, selection pressures, and the processes of speciation. Key to this analysis is gene flow, which facilitates the spread of advantageous traits and genetic diversity among populations. Conversely, isolation mechanisms like geographic or reproductive barriers restrict gene flow, promoting genetic differentiation and potentially leading to the emergence of new species through speciation. Natural selection operates on this genetic variation, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction in specific environments. Genetic drift and mutation further contribute to population dynamics, offering insights into overarching evolutionary patterns and collective population dynamics.\nAt the core of evolutionary theory also lies the change process occurring at the level of individual organisms or units. These changes encompass phenotypic, behavioral, or genetic mutations that occur in response to environmental pressures and internal dynamics. Once individual changes occur, they contribute to population genetic variation. Natural selection acts as a guiding force in this context, favoring traits that confer reproductive advantages or enhance survival in specific ecological niches. This selective process, influenced by environmental factors, determines the organism’s adaptation and reproductive success, thereby impacting its chances of survival. Over successive generations, advantageous traits increase in prevalence within populations, while less favorable traits diminish in frequency.\nAn evolutionary approach must therefore emphasize the interplay between changes occurring at the level of individual organisms and the broader evolutionary processes operating at the population and species levels. This integrated perspective should elucidate how changes at the individual level contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of species over time. By examining the interaction between individual-level adaptations and population-level dynamics, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms driving species evolution and adaptation across diverse ecological contexts.\n\n\n5.3.4 Environment\nThe environment plays a pivotal role in shaping evolutionary processes, providing the stage upon which populations and individuals interact and adapt. Within natural systems, the environment encompasses a spectrum of biotic and abiotic factors that influence species distribution, behavior, and evolutionary trajectories. Biotic factors involve interactions among living organisms, encompassing phenomena such as competition for resources, predation, and symbiotic relationships. Abiotic factors, on the other hand, include non-living elements like climate, geography, and physical resources. Together, these factors contribute to the dynamic complexity of ecosystems, demanding species to continuously adapt for survival and reproduction.\nIn addition to these environmental factors, evolutionary processes are driven by a series of exogenous and endogenous dynamic forces, each with varying intensities and directional impacts. Exogenous forces originate from external sources beyond individual organisms or ecosystems, such as climatic fluctuations, geological events, and rare phenomena like asteroid impacts. These external influences exert significant effects on habitats, species distributions, and overall evolutionary trajectories by modifying environmental conditions and triggering evolutionary responses. Conversely, endogenous forces arise from within organisms or ecosystems or result from interactions among organisms. These forces encompass genetic mutations, physiological responses, and ecological interactions within populations or ecosystems, shaping genetic compositions and population dynamics over time. Environmental forces and conditions are pivotal in determining organism fitness, steering natural selection, and molding evolutionary paths. This process compels species to develop traits and behaviors tailored to their environmental niche, thereby increasing their chances of survival and reproductive success.\nBoth factors and forces coexist synergistically, each playing complementary roles: factors establish the foundational conditions and contexts for life, including environmental conditions and biological interactions, while forces actively drive evolutionary changes within these established contexts. Factors thus create the stage upon which evolutionary dynamics unfold, while forces shape the evolutionary paths by influencing genetic diversity and population-level adaptations over successive generations. Therefore, comprehending the complex interplay between environmental factors and dynamic forces is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving ecosystem evolution over time. This understanding is crucial for unraveling species adaptation, biodiversity patterns, and the resilience of ecosystems in response to environmental changes and disturbances.\nUltimately, the environment is bounded by its historical trajectory. Past events such as environmental disturbances and climatic shifts leave enduring impacts on ecosystems, influencing species composition, habitat availability, and biodiversity patterns. Ecosystems with long histories often exhibit greater biodiversity and genetic resilience, while disturbances can create legacies that restrict adaptation. Integrating historical perspectives into evolutionary analysis provides valuable insights into path-dependent processes, informing conservation strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.\n\n\n5.3.5 Phenotypic traits\nThe structural and behavioral traits of individual organisms are fundamental to evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. Structural traits include physical characteristics such as morphology, anatomy, and physiology, which determine an organism’s form and function. These traits are crucial for the adaptation of organisms to their environment and their interactions with other species. Behavioral traits, on the other hand, encompass actions and responses exhibited by organisms in their environment, including feeding behaviors, mating rituals, communication signals, and social interactions.\nThe interplay between structural and behavioral traits shapes the ecological niche occupied by organisms and determines their fitness within a given environment. Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the emergence, loss, or modification of traits, thereby shaping the organism’s overall adaptive strategy. By examining the morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of organisms, valuable insights can be gained into the strategies employed by species, the dynamics of ecological communities, and the co-evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity over time.\n\n\n5.3.6 Adaptation\nAdaptation is a fundamental mechanism driving evolutionary change at the individual level within natural systems. Organisms continuously adjust their traits, behaviors, and physiological processes in response to selective pressures exerted by the environment. At its core, adaptation enables organisms to enhance their fitness and survival in specific ecological niches. Through the process of natural selection, individuals with traits that confer a reproductive advantage or improve survival under prevailing environmental conditions are more likely to pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, increasing their overall fitness and resilience to environmental challenges.\nAdaptation occurs through various mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, genetic mutations, and behavioral adjustments. Phenotypic plasticity allows traits to adjust to environmental cues, while mutations introduce genetic variation. Behavioral adaptations optimize resource use, predator avoidance, and reproduction. Understanding adaptation at the individual level is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and species diversification within natural systems. It can also shed light on species’ adaptive strategies, the emergence of novel traits, and the dynamics of ecological interactions along a period of time.\n\n\n5.3.7 Heredity\nHeredity refers to the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, playing a central role in evolutionary processes. Genetic material, encoded in DNA molecules, contains the instructions for an organism’s development, growth, and functioning. The mechanisms of heredity involve the replication and transmission of genetic material through processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Genetic variation arises from mutations, genetic recombination, and other mechanisms, leading to differences in traits among individuals within populations. Understanding heredity is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change, as it influences the diversity, adaptation, and persistence of species over time.\nHeredity is linked to reproduction as it governs the transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. This connection is vital because heredity, through the transmission of DNA, ensures the continuity of genetic traits across generations, providing the raw material for evolutionary change. Additionally, genetic variation resulting from mutations and recombination during reproduction introduces diversity within populations, fueling the process of natural selection and facilitating adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Thus, investigating the relationship between heredity and reproduction is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that underpin individual change processes and their broader implications for evolutionary dynamics within natural systems.\n\n\n5.3.8 Reproduction\nReproduction is a fundamental process driving evolutionary dynamics at the individual level. Through the production of offspring, organisms perpetuate their genetic lineage and pass on hereditary traits, ensuring the continuity of life and preserving genetic diversity within populations. Both sexual and asexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation, enriching the population’s genetic pool. Various factors, including mate choice, mating behaviors, reproductive timing, and reproductive success, influence the reproductive process, thereby impacting the genetic composition and evolutionary trajectory of species.\nModern evolutionary theory emphasizes reproductive success as the primary driver of selection, with the ability to transmit genetic information to offspring being paramount. This shift towards a focus on reproductive success has led to increased research on sexual selection and reproductive mechanisms, including the role of geographic barriers in species diversification. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for comprehending evolutionary processes in both natural and other systems. However, this perspective has faced criticism, notably from Stephen Jay Gould, who argued against it (2002). Ultimately, examining the reproductive process at the individual level is key to generating insights into the adaptive strategies employed by species, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the evolutionary forces influencing populations over time.\n\n\n5.3.9 Variation\nIn evolutionary science, “variation” refers to the diversity of traits and characteristics observed within populations, shaped by underlying genetic and environmental factors. Understanding variation is integral to the study of populations as it reveals the range of phenotypic and genotypic differences within and among species. Variation is intrinsically linked to competition and selection, as individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits to future generations. This differential reproductive success propagates favorable traits over successive generations, driving evolutionary change.\nMoreover, variation is closely connected to the concept of mutation, which introduces new genetic variants into populations. While not all mutations result in significant changes, with many being neutral, some can lead to notable phenotypic differences that may confer advantages or disadvantages. The evolutionary analyst will need to consider the role of the environment in determining which mutated traits spread within a population and which do not.\n\n\n5.3.10 Competition\nCompetition is a fundamental force driving evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. It arises when organisms vie for limited resources such as food, water, or territory. This competitive pressure favors traits that provide a competitive edge, leading to evolutionary changes over time and the inheritance of these beneficial traits by offspring. Within populations, competition manifests in various forms, including direct competition for resources, interference competition through aggressive interactions, and exploitative competition where one species outcompetes another for resources. These competitive interactions can lead to niche differentiation strategies, where species partition resources to reduce competition and coexist within the same habitat. Additionally, competition can drive evolutionary innovation and adaptation, as species evolve traits and behaviors to outcompete rivals. This dynamic can result in the diversification of species and the development of complex ecological interactions over evolutionary timescales.\nUltimately, competition sets the stage for natural selection to act. It results in the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, while less advantageous traits are outcompeted and reduced in frequency. Understanding competition dynamics is therefore crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind species interactions, community dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories in natural ecosystems. Through the study of competitive interactions and their consequences, the evolutionary analyst can gain insights into the processes shaping biodiversity, ecological resilience, and ecosystem stability.\n\n\n5.3.11 Selection\nSelection mechanisms operate on the diversity of individual units, favoring traits that confer competitive advantages and improve survival. These processes are crucial drivers of evolutionary change. Natural selection, a primary mechanism, favors traits that improve an organism’s fitness and reproductive success in a given environment. Through this process, individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on their genetic material to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits within populations, driving evolutionary adaptation to changing environmental conditions.\nHowever, although natural selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, selection operates through various mechanisms, including directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection. Directional selection shifts traits towards one extreme, stabilizing selection maintains the status quo within a population, and disruptive selection leads to divergence. Understanding these selection processes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and biodiversity within natural systems."

    "section": "6.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method",
    "text": "6.4 The Use of a Synthesis Method\nThere are arguments about whether it is feasible or acceptable to conduct syntheses of qualitative evidence at all,41 and whether it is acceptable to synthesise qualitative studies derived from different traditions. The distinctions, tensions and conflicts between these have been vividly described.@dixon2005synthesising\nPerhaps even more likely to generate controversy are attempts to synthesise qualitative and quantitative evidence. It is evident from the discussion above that synthesis of diverse forms of evidence will generally involve conversion of qualitative data into quantitative form or vice versa. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nShould reviews start with a well-defined question and how many papers are required? The issue of questions is an important one for syntheses. It will be clear that the methods described above will be more suited to some questions than others: for example questions concerning causality may be better suited to qualitative comparative analysis than questions concerned with the production of mid-range theory, which might be better suited to meta-ethnography. The issue of how questions should be identified and formulated in the first instance is one on which there is much uncertainty.\nEstabrooks et al, like many in the systematic review community, argue that review questions should be selected to focus on similar populations or themes.43 However, others point out that in primary qualitative research, definitions of the phenomenon emerge from the data.15 Whether one should start with an a priori definition of the phenomenon for purposes of a secondary synthesis is therefore an important question.@dixon2005synthesising\nA related issue is how to limit the number of papers included in the review. One approach is to narrow the focus. An alternative strategy is offered by theoretical sampling, used in primary qualitative research with a view towards the evolving development of the concepts. Sampling continues until theoretical saturation is reached, where no new relevant data seem to emerge regarding a category, either to extend or contradict it.45 It has been suggested that this approach would also be suitable for selecting papers for inclusion in reviews.46–48 However, the application of this form of sampling has been rarely tested empirically, and some express anxiety that this may result in the omission of relevant data, thus limiting the understanding of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nAppraising studies for inclusion The issue of how or whether to appraise qualitative papers for inclusion in a review has received a great deal of attention. The NHS CRD guidance emphasises the need for a structured approach to quality assessment for qualitative studies to be included in reviews, but also recognises the difficulties of achieving consensus on the criteria that might constitute quality standards.5 Some argue that weak papers should be excluded. Others, however, propose that papers should not be excluded for reasons of quality, particularly where this might result in synthesisers discounting important studies for the sake of ‘surface mistakes’, which are distinguished from fatal mistakes that invalidate the finding.Published examples include reviews that have chosen not to appraise the papers,14 as well as those which have opted to appraise the papers using a formalised approach.22 If the argument prevails that some quality appraisal is necessary, the problem then arises as to how this should be undertaken. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)\nConclusions There is an urgent need for rigorous methods for synthesising evidence of diverse types generated by diverse methodologies. These methods are required to meet the needs of policy-makers and practitioners, who need to be able to benefit from the range of evidence available. Dixon-Woods et al. (2005)"

    "text": "6.5 Practical Implications\n\n6.5.1 Evolutionary analyst\nOne of the practical benefits derived from the present proposal of formulating an evolutionary systems analytical framework is to determine the need to have professionals with an evolutionary analyst profile. An evolutionary analyst is understood to be an academic or professional who has a clear and deep understanding of the evolutionary functioning of systems and who is capable of using rigorous analysis and tools to determine the factors that explain their essence and elements of change.\n\n\n6.5.2 Prediction ability\nIf we are able to acquire a deep understanding of the functioning of the evolutionary system, its components, behaviors and flow of changes, we can then better foresee in which direction the evolutionary system is moving and glimpse whether the system has the capacity to survive or, on the contrary, is doomed to disappearance.\nIt is worth considering the possibility of whether, based on increasingly deeper knowledge of the evolution of a system, it would be possible to act on the future of the system. In other words, if it could be feasible to design your own plan and carry it out based on the knowledge generated about the evolution of the system.\nTo what extent is the system under observation random in change or does it evidence a logic that can be known and even altered based on our desires or needs?\n\n\n6.5.3 Manipulation of the system and its programmability\nIf they were really able to manipulate the system as we wish, on what elements would it be most feasible to do so? Would it be possible to act on both the structural and behavioral elements, only on one of them? Being able to act on a known evolutionary system would open new and great opportunities to design systems that meet a wide diversity of needs.\nThe above would necessarily entail having to assess the ethical problems of altering the course of nature and the new problems that would emerge by distorting the natural mechanisms of the functioning of life and society. The opposite position would be to conclude that the system is unalterable and we cannot intelligently design it to satisfy our desires.\nSociety would go from a stage in which social systems are considered elusive to another in which we would be able to know to what extent their evolution is random, to what extent there is causality and to what extent they are programmable.\n\n\n6.5.4 Inform and activate policies\nAn evolutionary analysis framework can serve to inform who cannot support themselves, namely, who is more likely to survive and continue competitive, and who is threatened by disappearance.\nIdentifying who dominates over whom, that is, elucidating the relationships and power structures has great significance, but it is also a way to understand how species advance. In fact, the process of replacement or extinction of species is an essential aspect to understand human progress.\nThe level at which the analyst expects to inform policy, or the level of contribution expected by decision makers from an evolutionary model, is a factor in determining the level of analysis to be used in the “struggle for existence.”\nAdditionally, if education (education policies) could improve individuals, the benefits could perhaps be passed on through inheritance (this is a Lamarckian view).\n\n\n6.5.5 Overcoming the barriers that prevent systematic struggle\nFrom the RQs: Another question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual permits the struggle to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.\nThis leads us to the recommendation, in some circumstances mediated by policies, that the struggle does not have constraints that condition it. Thus, as the environment continues to pose challenges that must be faced (resolved) by the individual, progress will continues.\n\n\n6.5.6 Eugenics of individuals\nThe above leads us to the problem of eugenics, and the reflection on to what extent the system must ensure that the selection produces and there are no barriers for it to unfold its effects.\n\n\n6.5.7 The connection with complex systems\nThe analysis of evolutionary systems demonstrates a connection with complex systems, such that species should be seen as complex systems with an enormous amount of variation, stimulated by selection.\n\n\n6.5.8 The contribution of this review to policy\nThe key message from this systematic review is that interventions will not work unless public views about the value, safety, benefits and costs of walking and cycling are taken into account. This information will thus be of interest to parents and children, government policy-makers at the national and local level, schools, and research funding bodies. Policy-makers need to understand that perceived safety is a key influence on walking and cycling, but that environmental improvements and facilities can encourage a shift away from car culture.@brunton2006synthesis"

    "section": "6.6 Framework Thematic Discussion",
    "text": "6.6 Framework Thematic Discussion\n\n6.6.1 On Evolution\nWhen addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what the unit of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied. This is a discussion that has changed over time, having moved from the individual organism to what is currently considered a more correct approach, the gene. What the above means is that instead of prioritizing “adaptive fitness” in the analysis, today it seems more appropriate to focus on the reproductive success of the individual. This new perspective has given rise to the movement of ultra-Darwinism.\nThe analysis of evolutionary stratigraphy, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.\nThe geological law of superposition, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.\n\n6.6.1.1 Hierarchy\nThe idea of hierarchy involves something on top down to somethinge else.\nOnce the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the hierarchical structure of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Classification\nA classification or taxonomy is a procedure used to better understand the diversity (and variation) of organisms.\nWhen studying the evolution of a population, building a classification or taxonomy of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through.\nWith a classification or taxonomy the analyst can study the diversity of the units (species) based e.g. in their morphology, as well as the ecological relationships that exist between them.\nIn the history of evolution, three major frameworks for classifying species are usually proposed:\n\nChain of being (Bonnet) -&gt; it is a hierarchical chain of relationships\nThe rope of being (Rubinet)\nLineo taxonomy based on visible resemblances (with no hierarchy)\n\n\n\n6.6.1.3 Miscelaneous\nThe idea of the extent to which the history of “life” has been progressive but in an irregular way.\nThe idea of “emergent evolution” (Lloyd Morgan) which highlights the new high-level properties that appear as evolution reaches a certain level of complexity.\n\n\n\n6.6.2 On the Origin\nThe idea of the Origin is consubstantially associated with the idea of an end, since everything that begins must necessarily have an end.\nThe problem of origin is closed related to the problem of generation, thus the evolutionary analyst must elucidate whether the origin of the unit is spontaneous, preformationist, etc.\nAn alternative perspective to the problem of origin can be raised from biogenesis (life arising from non-living matter) and the “primordial soup” (Opsin), that is, the combination of elements that gives rise to the synthesis of compounds ” organic” after adding energy to the system (from lightning, UVA radiation, volcanic activity, etc.)\n\n\n6.6.3 On the Environment\n\n6.6.3.1 On the Forces\nWe do not know the forces (and their sources) that operate driving the process of change in the individuals of a population.\nApart from the forces that operate at the level of individuals, it is necessary to know what the transmission mechanisms are like from the environment to the individual, between individuals, and vice versa, from the individual to the environment.\nWhat is the materiality of the pressure for change exerted by an environmental force?\n\n\n6.6.3.2 On Selection\nOne of the most difficult questions that every evolutionary analyst must face is how the selection process imposed by the environment actually work, and to what extent different alternative selection approaches can help explain the evolutionary course of the system.\nWe refer to the selection process not as the blind application of a closed paradigm that we know a priori will provide an explanatory response to the evolution of any system, but rather the analyst evaluates to what degree alternative selection models can provide insight into our understanding of the evolution of the system. It is about better understanding how rival visions can have a place in our understanding of the evolutionary phenomena of the system, even in an open and simultaneous way.\n\n\n\n6.6.4 On the Unit\n\n6.6.4.1 On the Structure\n\n\n6.6.4.2 On the Behavior\nTo what extent is the system’s behavior governed by inherited instincts? And to what extent can the selection process alter instincts? Are instincts constraints to the development of behavior and the process of change, or are they not such constraints?\nWhat behavioral traits can be considered innate and which are constructed with the interaction with the natural and social environment? What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?\nPerhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.\nCan individual behavior be predicted? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.\nTo what extent can learning and technology affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?\nThe problem of hierarchy can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g. intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?\nIt is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to control genes and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)\n\n\n\n6.6.5 On Change\nWe know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the historical past as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.\nIf change does not leave any proof (of evolution), why don’t we seek indirect progress (i.e. the equivalent of fossils)?\nIt is necessary to know which components of the individual’s structure (or flows) the forces of the environment act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.\nAlso relevant is the question of how the development process of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.\nDoes the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any goal or objective? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual’s process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g. a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?\nIn the analysis of evolutionary dynamics, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.\nWhat are the change mechanisms used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:\n\nHybridization\nRecombination\netc.\n\nTo what extent is the timeline for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.\nSpeaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary “clock” of the system. The idea of the clock is to explain traits that evolve at a constant rate overtime, due to underlying molecular mechanisms. In other words, that would explain the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time.\nIt is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.\nA possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as punctuated equilibria”. According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis.\nThe evolutionary analyst should open to the notion of arrow of time, and the preferred direction or sequence of change. And if the change process is reversible vs irreversible (with higher entropy). In turn, this should lead the analyst to consider the predictability or unpredictability of evolution.\nIs the result of evolution the same system of a new one?\n\n\n6.6.6 On Heredity\nWhat are the limits of heredity (change)?\n\n\n\n\nBrunton, Ginny, Sandy Oliver, Kathryn Oliver, and Theo Lorenc. 2006. “A Synthesis of Research Addressing Children’s, Young People’s and Parents Views of Walking and Cycling for Transport.”\n\n\nDixon-Woods, Mary, Shona Agarwal, David Jones, Bridget Young, and Alex Sutton. 2005. “Synthesising Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence: A Review of Possible Methods.” Journal of Health Services Research & Policy 10 (1): 45–53.\n\n\nOliver, Sandy R, Rebecca W Rees, Lorna Clarke-Jones, Ruairidh Milne, Ann R Oakley, John Gabbay, Ken Stein, Phyll Buchanan, and Gill Gyte. 2008. “A Multidimensional Conceptual Framework for Analysing Public Involvement in Health Services Research.” Health Expectations 11 (1): 72–84.\n\n\nWaters, Lea, and Daniel Loton. 2019. “SEARCH: A Meta-Framework and Review of the Field of Positive Education.” International Journal of Applied Positive Psychology 4: 1–46."

    "text": "7.1 Natural Science as the Cornerstone of Evolutionary Inquiry\nThe study of evolution in the natural sciences serves as a foundational pillar for understanding evolutionary phenomena across various disciplines due to its fundamental principles and overarching explanatory power. Evolutionary theory, rooted in biology and natural selection, elucidates the mechanisms driving change and adaptation in living organisms over time. These principles extend beyond biology, providing insights into the dynamics of change, adaptation, and innovation in diverse systems, including social, economic, and cultural domains. By examining how species evolve and interact within their environments, evolutionary science offers valuable analogies and frameworks for understanding analogous processes in other disciplines. Consequently, evolutionary concepts serve as a unifying framework, facilitating interdisciplinary research and fostering a deeper understanding of complex phenomena across different fields. Thus, the study of evolution in the natural sciences not only enriches our understanding of biological systems but also provides valuable insights into the dynamics of change and adaptation in broader contexts."

    "text": "7.2 What is a Framework?\nAt a general level, in this paper a framework is understood as an abstraction: a type of mental and communicative construct to help build a coherent world view. A framework is not always visible to the user, but a framework for the use of indicators in a decision making context should be designed in a conscious, communicative process (15). Assmuth & Hildén (16) define frameworks as “the conceptual and procedural constructs that assimilate, process, and give meaning to information”. This definition highlights two dimensions to help frameworks do precisely this: 1) the ‘conceptual’ dimension that aims to capture the substance or essence of what is to be measured and elucidated (for example, frameworks to measure ‘sustainability’ organized in the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) domains), and 2) the ‘procedural’ or ‘operational’ dimension, which refers to more practical concerns – who needs to do what to collect, produce and report the required information? A third important dimension not highlighted by Assmuth and Hilden’s definition concerns the purpose of the information, what is termed hereon the ‘utilization’ function.

It should, above all, allow for a structuring of the empirical analysis of frameworks adopted by agencies in practice. Such analysis will review how the conceptual, operational and utilization functions of a case framework are performed, and how the most important criteria for each function are fulfilled.

    "text": "2.1 Dispersion\nKnowledge dispersion refers to the widespread distribution of information across diverse sources, disciplines, and domains. It reflects the multiplicity of perspectives, theories, and methodologies that exist within different areas of knowledge. Dispersion is evident in the varied insights found across numerous fields, publications, and researchers. Each discipline contributes its specialized knowledge, creating a rich tapestry of perspectives that enhances the overall understanding within the academic landscape. However, in such a dispersed environment, knowledge takes on different forms and becomes accessible primarily to individuals within specific fields, fostering information asymmetry between disciplines. Experts within their domains can readily access and utilize relevant knowledge, while those outside these fields often encounter barriers that hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange. Furthermore, dispersion promotes specialization within disciplines, as researchers focus deeply on narrow topics within their areas of expertise, further fragmenting knowledge into specialized subfields.\nIn the field of evolutionary thought, the dispersion of knowledge arises from a complex interplay of historical, interdisciplinary, and methodological factors, highlighting the diverse and multifaceted nature of evolutionary inquiry. Over time, evolutionary theory has given rise to various paradigms and theoretical frameworks, each reflecting different interpretations and emphases within the discipline. Interdisciplinary engagement has been central to this dispersion, intersecting with numerous fields such as biology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and economics. Each discipline approaches evolutionary phenomena from its unique perspective, leading to diverse interpretations and methodologies. Consequently, evolutionary insights become dispersed across disciplinary boundaries, reflecting the varied lenses through which scholars from different fields view evolutionary processes.\nThe broad applicability of evolutionary principles to diverse phenomena further contributes to this dispersion. From biological evolution to cultural dynamics and economic behavior, evolutionary concepts resonate across a wide array of domains, resulting in the dispersion of evolutionary insights across disparate fields of study. Methodological pluralism within evolutionary thought further amplifies this dispersion. Scholars employ a variety of empirical, qualitative, mathematical, computational, and comparative approaches to investigate evolutionary processes, each yielding unique insights and perspectives. These methodological preferences vary across disciplines and research traditions, creating a highly dispersed landscape of evolutionary inquiry."

    "text": "2.2 Fragmentation\nKnowledge fragmentation involves the compartmentalization and isolation of information into distinct fragments or disciplines, each characterized by specific boundaries and specialized focus areas. Fragmentation creates disciplinary silos where researchers operate within narrow domains of expertise and research, often with limited interaction or collaboration across fields. These silos are upheld by disciplinary boundaries that define the scope of each field and restrict the flow of information and ideas between disciplines. As a result, researchers within fragmented fields may adopt reductionist approaches, simplifying complex phenomena to fit within their disciplinary frameworks.\nThe impact of knowledge fragmentation can be profound, creating barriers to the integration and synthesis of knowledge across disciplines. By reinforcing disciplinary boundaries, fragmentation impedes interdisciplinary collaboration and hampers efforts to develop comprehensive, holistic understandings of complex phenomena. Moreover, fragmentation can lead to a narrow perspective among researchers, who may become entrenched in their disciplinary viewpoints and methodologies, potentially overlooking valuable insights from other fields. This narrow focus can result in duplicated efforts as researchers within fragmented disciplines inadvertently replicate studies or fail to consider relevant findings from complementary fields, resulting in inefficiencies and redundancy.\nThe fragmentation of evolutionary thought into disciplinary silos and compartments is driven by a combination of historical, methodological, and institutional factors that continue to influence the field today. These factors have significantly shaped the evolution and structure of evolutionary studies. Despite efforts to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and integration, disciplinary boundaries persist, often reinforced by institutional structures, funding mechanisms, and academic incentives. These boundaries limit the exchange of ideas and hinder the development of comprehensive, holistic understandings of evolutionary processes. For example, evolutionary economics and evolutionary biology often operate in separate academic spheres, with economists focusing on market dynamics, innovation, and firm behavior, while biologists concentrate on genetic and ecological aspects of evolution. This separation is maintained by distinct funding sources, specialized journals, and academic departments, which can discourage collaboration and the sharing of insights between these disciplines. As a result, important connections between biological evolution and economic behaviors may be overlooked or underexplored, such as how evolutionary principles can inform the understanding of market adaptations and organizational strategies. Overcoming these challenges requires dedicated efforts to break down interdisciplinary barriers, encourage collaboration among scholars from different disciplines, and integrate diverse perspectives within the field of evolutionary thought."

    "text": "2.3 Reductionism\nReductionism involves dissecting complex phenomena into isolated components or subsystems, often at the expense of understanding the system as a whole and neglecting a holistic perspective. While this approach can yield valuable insights, it can also obscure the broader context and interconnections between different parts of a system. When scholars focus on isolated elements rather than the interactions and relationships among them, reductionism limits the scope of research and the potential for integrative theories and solutions.\nIn evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of the firm this reductionist tendency appears when scholars concentrate solely on specific aspects or subtopics without considering the interconnectedness and interdependencies within the broader evolutionary framework. For example, researchers might focus exclusively on technological innovation within firms, analyzing how specific advancements influence firm performance. While this focus is valuable, it may overlook the interactions between these innovations and other factors such as market conditions, regulatory environments, and organizational culture. Without considering these interactions, the analysis remains incomplete and potentially misses key insights into the firm’s overall evolutionary dynamics.\nThe risks associated with reductionist approaches are multifaceted. First, reductionism can result in a loss of context, where researchers fail to recognize the broader factors influencing economic evolution and firm behavior. By isolating specific components or mechanisms, scholars may overlook the environmental, social, and institutional dynamics that shape evolutionary processes within the economic landscape. Second, reductionism may fail to capture emergent properties inherent within complex economic systems. For instance, in evolutionary economics, interactions among diverse economic agents and institutions often give rise to emergent phenomena that cannot be understood by examining components in isolation. Failure to recognize and account for these emergent properties may lead to a limited understanding of economic evolution and dynamics.\nFurthermore, reductionism may impede the ability to effectively address complex problems. Many economic phenomena, including firm behavior and market dynamics, are inherently complex and multifaceted, requiring a holistic understanding to develop comprehensive solutions. Scholars using reductionist approaches often overlook the interconnections and interactions crucial for understanding complex systems, leading to incomplete or erroneous conclusions that fail to address the full scope of a problem. Ultimately, reductionist approaches that oversimplify these problems may result in inadequate policy prescriptions or managerial interventions that do not address their underlying complexity.\nReductionism can also impede interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge integration within evolutionary economics and the evolutionary analysis of firms. Given the inherently interdisciplinary nature of these fields, effective research often necessitates integrating insights from diverse disciplines, including economics, biology, psychology, and sociology. Reductionist tendencies restrict researchers’ capacity to engage with broader interdisciplinary questions and inhibit the synthesis of knowledge across different domains. Consequently, this overspecialization may stifle the advancement of the discipline by limiting opportunities for innovation and the cross-fertilization of ideas."

Firstly, a meta-framework, essentially a synthesis of existing frameworks, offers a robust methodological approach to address the dispersed nature of knowledge on firm evolution. By integrating insights from evolutionary economics, organizational theory, and related disciplines, our meta-framework establishes a unifying structure that bridges diverse research strands related to firm behavior. This holistic perspective fills the gap between micro-level organizational dynamics and macro-level environmental influences. Given the inherent complexity of this field, a meta-framework serves as a powerful tool for scholars and practitioners. It empowers them to develop more effective strategies for managing organizational change, fostering innovation, and adapting to dynamic market environments, ultimately leading to significant benefits.\nSecondly, the meta-framework functions as a methodological bridge between theoretical concepts and empirical observations in evolutionary firm analysis. It provides a structured framework for organizing diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiries. This equips researchers with a standardized vocabulary of core concepts and essential terms necessary for constructing causal explanations. This systematic methodology fosters rigor and coherence in research endeavors, enabling clearer interpretations of empirical findings and propelling the advancement of theoretical developments concerning firm behavior.\nThirdly, the meta-framework facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing a shared language and conceptual framework for scholars and practitioners across diverse disciplinary backgrounds. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, the meta-framework encourages the exchange of knowledge and collaboration among researchers, fostering innovative insights and perspectives. This interdisciplinary approach is increasingly important for addressing complex research questions that necessitate multifaceted analyses drawing from multiple knowledge domains.\nFourth, the inherent step-by-step procedural method employed in constructing the meta-framework ensures a high level of transparency, thus allowing for a clear delineation of the systematic processes guiding data analysis, from descriptive elucidation to explanatory inference. This transparency extends to the researchers’ interpretative efforts, ensuring a traceable trajectory of analytical insights throughout any study related to firm behavior.\nFifth, unlike other qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, constructing a meta-framework adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby accommodation to a wider range of data types and research contexts (Goldsmith 2021; Gale et al. 2013). This flexibility is critical for our investigation, as we utilize primary and secondary data from both conceptual and empirical studies across the natural and social sciences.

    "text": "4.6 Final Meta-Framework Specification\nIn the last stage of our meta-framework building process, the focus shifted towards refining the a priori meta-framework and ensuring the robustness of the meta analysis. A thorough review process was conducted to ensure the reliability and relevance of both the coding and the new themes emerging from it. This involved critical examination of the whole work, carefully evaluating each theme to ensure faithful representation of the data within or outside the scope of the a priori meta-framework. As a result, the initial a priori meta-framework was further refined and extended to achieve a more accurate reflection of the extracted data.\nNext, the relationships between the new themes and the a priori themes were reexamined to generate meaningful insights into how they interact and influence one another. This interpretation, grounded in both the empirical data and the original a priori meta-framework, led to a revised conceptual meta-framework that provides a coherent and comprehensive explanation of the evolutionary behavior of the firm.\nBy adhering to these systematic steps, a final meta-framework was formulated, characterized by both rigor and adaptability. The meta-framework offers valuable insights that contribute to our understanding of evolutionary firm behavior. The transparent, comprehensive, and empirically grounded approach employed in its development ensures the meta-framework’s robustness as a tool for advancing both theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of evolutionary firm analysis. Notably, the final meta-framework integrates the a priori themes with those newly identified during the systematic literature reviews. This comprehensive model captures the full spectrum of relevant themes and their interrelationships, providing a nuanced and detailed understanding of the studied concepts, relations, and data."

The first strand delved into the domain of evolutionary economics, with a particular focus on the analysis of firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. The second strand explored case studies that utilized evolutionary concepts and/or frameworks to investigate the dynamics of the firm. Each review employed a distinct search strategy to ensure methodological rigor and the identification of high-quality research. Both WOS and SCOPUS databases were targeted to maximize the rigor and quality of the search.\nThe first thematic review adopted a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing relevant scholarship pertaining to the fundamental tenets and interconnected concepts that characterize the evolutionary view of the firm. To capture the broadest possible range of ideas and perspectives, the review employed broad search terms and an extensive time-frame. The second review focused on case studies that analyzed firm behavior through an evolutionary lens. This review encompassed articles that explicitly contained the term “evolution” and/or “evolutionary” in their titles and those that analyzed the behavior of the firm in an evolutionary way although they did not explicitly contained the term “evolution” or “evolutionary” in the title. To identify the latter, a qualitative research technique known as “pearl-growing” was employed. This technique metaphorically refers to the process of iteratively accumulating valuable “pearls” of information by expanding the search based on references, citations, or recommendations found in an initial set of identified sources. In our context, the “pearls” were found after the valuable insights gained from the references and citations included in the first systematic literature review."

    "text": "5.3 Choosing a Knowledge Baseline\nUnlike traditional meta-framework synthesis approaches, which typically require extensive literature reviews, consultations, and deep topic expertise to develop an a priori framework, our approach focused on selecting a seminal work from the existing literature that thoroughly addressed the key concepts and relationships defining evolution in the natural sciences. This reference work provided a foundational knowledge base for elucidating our a priori framework, simplifying the subsequent coding and synthesis process while eliminating the need for extensive preparatory efforts.\nThe selected work was Peter J. Bowler’s seminal book, “Evolution: The History of an Idea” (2009), which examines the historical trajectory of evolutionary thought and offers a comprehensive foundation for understanding the development of economic systems. Bowler’s interdisciplinary perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of economic processes as evolving systems shaped by continuous change. His analysis provides valuable insights for evolutionary economics by uncovering the historical origins of evolutionary ideas and their relevance to economic analysis.\nBowler’s work is also relevant to our research for its exploration of the interplay between cultural, scientific, and anthropological factors in shaping evolutionary theories. In the book, the author traces the development of evolutionary thought from its origins in ancient Greece to its modern understanding, highlighting how societal beliefs and values influenced these concepts. His insights are particularly valuable for evolutionary economists, as it underscores the importance of understanding the cultural and ideological contexts in which economic systems emerge and evolve.\nThe author delves into the diverse contributions of key figures to evolutionary thought, examining the ideas and theories of prominent thinkers and highlighting their impact on the evolution of the field. Understanding this intellectual lineage enriches our a priori meta-framework by offering valuable insights into the historical foundations of contemporary economic theories and methodologies. Bowler’s analysis further emphasizes the diversity of perspectives within evolutionary thought, providing a wide array of ideas to inform the analysis of evolutionary economic systems.\nUltimately, Bowler’s book explores the controversies and debates surrounding the concept of evolution, highlighting the different interpretations and challenges to evolutionary theory throughout history. This aspect is particularly relevant for constructing our a priori meta-framework, as it emphasizes the complex and multifaceted nature of economic evolution. By examining historical debates over evolutionary theory, our a priori meta-framework gains a deeper appreciation for the contested nature of economic processes and the diverse array of factors that shape them. Bowler’s nuanced analysis encourages critical engagement with evolutionary concepts and methodologies, fostering a more robust and interdisciplinary approach to studying economic systems.\nIn conclusion, Bowler’s comprehensive treatise on evolution provides a robust foundation for understanding key themes in evolution and aggregate dimensions, serving as the baseline for elucidating our a priori meta-framework."

    "section": "5.4 Elucidating the A Priori Meta-Framework",
    "text": "5.4 Elucidating the A Priori Meta-Framework\nThe a priori framework is a preliminary conceptual structure developed before the main meta-synthesis process begins. It serves as a foundation for organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data in a systematic manner. The main components of the a priori meta-framework include:\n\nThemes: Broad, overarching concepts and categories that capture key aspects of evolutionary natural processes. Each theme and categories encapsulate essential aspects of evolutionary theory, illuminating the intricate mechanisms governing evolution and evolutionary behavior.\nRelationships: Connections or interactions between the identified themes, illustrating how they influence or depend on each other.\nGuiding Structure: A logical template or model that directs data mapping and coding during the synthesis process, ensuring coherence and alignment with the research objectives.\n\nBy providing a structured starting point, the a priori framework serves as a template for coding data extracted during the literature review in the later stages of this research.\nThe resulting a priori meta-framework contains the following key themes and relationships (Fig. 1):\n\n\n\nFig1. The a priori meta-framework. Source: own elaboration based on Bowler (2009)\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Unit of analysis\nIn evolutionary studies, the unit of analysis represents the fundamental entity on which observations and analyses are centered. Historically, this focus has shifted over time. Initially, attention was directed toward the organism –defined in biology as an individual living entity, such as a plant, animal, or microorganism capable of independent existence and reproduction. Later, the emphasis shifted to populations and, following the modern synthesis, to genes. Identifying the primary unit of analysis within each system under investigation is a critical first step for evolutionary analysts and a foundational element of the analytical process.\nDespite the aforementioned shifts in the locus of analysis, the individual organism remains a cornerstone in evolutionary studies, representing a single, discrete entity within a given population. However, distinguishing between the individual organism and the population as units of analysis is crucial for any evolutionary study. The individual organism represents a single instance of life, while the population comprises a group of organisms of the same species occupying a defined geographical area and sharing genetic similarities. The individual organism serves as the building block of the population, with its traits, behaviors, and adaptations contributing to the collective dynamics of the population. This fundamental differentiation between individual and population units of analysis can be illustrated in Darwin’s theory, which encompasses both types of units. Natural selection operates at the level of the individual organism, influencing the frequencies of traits within a population over time.\nThe selection of a specific unit of analysis significantly influences the scope and focus of evolutionary approaches. Analyzing individual organisms allows researchers to examine specific traits, behaviors, and adaptations within a single entity, providing insights into microevolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. Conversely, studying populations enables researchers to investigate macroevolutionary patterns and trends, such as speciation and diversification, by considering the collective dynamics and genetic variability within and between populations. While the individual organism offers granularity in understanding the mechanisms of evolutionary change at a local level, the population provides a broader perspective on the dynamics of species evolution and adaptation over time. Both units of analysis are integral to comprehensively elucidating the complexities of evolution within natural systems. They highlight the interplay between individual-level characteristics and population-level dynamics in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species.\n\n\n5.4.2 Origin\nThe emergence of a population from individuals significantly shapes the evolutionary trajectory of the natural system. Therefore, investigating the origin of individuals is paramount in evolutionary analysis, as it addresses fundamental inquiries regarding the emergence, diversification, distribution, and persistence of life forms on Earth. This line of inquiry involves examining evidence from the past to gain insights into the mechanisms governing the origination and divergence of new species from common ancestors. Subsequently, attention shifts towards understanding the trend towards increased complexity and the underlying forces driving this evolutionary trend.\nThe concept of “origin” in evolutionary studies is closely intertwined with that of “generation” and “developmental processes”, collectively enhancing our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. While the study of “origin” focuses on the emergence of new species or lineages, marking the beginning of their subsequent evolutionary trajectory and setting the stage for evolutionary change within populations, the study of “generation” concerns the production of offspring or new individuals within a population. In essence, while the study of “origin” examines how new species arise and diverge from common ancestors, the study of “generation” delves into the mechanisms by which new individuals are generated and their contributions to genetic variation and evolutionary change within populations. Thus, an examination of reproductive processes and their impacts on population and species dynamics becomes essential.\nUltimately, “developmental” constraints also play a key role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of individuals and populations. Embryonic development imposes constraints on the types of changes organisms can undergo over time, highlighting the integral role of embryological processes within evolutionary systems. Exploring the patterns and constraints of embryonic development provides valuable insights into the mechanisms propelling evolutionary change and diversification in natural systems.\n\n\n5.4.3 Evolutionary vs Change process\nEvolutionary processes involve dynamic mechanisms that drive changes at the population level across successive generations. Instead of acting solely on individual organisms, these mechanisms accumulate inherited changes within populations. Studying evolution at the population level provides insights into broad patterns of genetic variation, selection pressures, and the processes of speciation. Key to this analysis is gene flow, which facilitates the spread of advantageous traits and genetic diversity among populations. Conversely, isolation mechanisms like geographic or reproductive barriers restrict gene flow, promoting genetic differentiation and potentially leading to the emergence of new species through speciation. Natural selection operates on this genetic variation, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction in specific environments. Genetic drift and mutation further contribute to population dynamics, offering insights into overarching evolutionary patterns and collective population dynamics.\nAt the core of evolutionary theory also lies the change process occurring at the level of individual organisms or units. These changes encompass phenotypic, behavioral, or genetic mutations that occur in response to environmental pressures and internal dynamics. Once individual changes occur, they contribute to population genetic variation. Natural selection acts as a guiding force in this context, favoring traits that confer reproductive advantages or enhance survival in specific ecological niches. This selective process, influenced by environmental factors, determines the organism’s adaptation and reproductive success, thereby impacting its chances of survival. Over successive generations, advantageous traits increase in prevalence within populations, while less favorable traits diminish in frequency.\nAn evolutionary approach must therefore emphasize the interplay between changes occurring at the level of individual organisms and the broader evolutionary processes operating at the population and species levels. This integrated perspective should elucidate how changes at the individual level contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of species over time. By examining the interaction between individual-level adaptations and population-level dynamics, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanisms driving species evolution and adaptation across diverse ecological contexts.\n\n\n5.4.4 Environment\nThe environment plays a pivotal role in shaping evolutionary processes, providing the stage upon which populations and individuals interact and adapt. Within natural systems, the environment encompasses a spectrum of biotic and abiotic factors that influence species distribution, behavior, and evolutionary trajectories. Biotic factors involve interactions among living organisms, encompassing phenomena such as competition for resources, predation, and symbiotic relationships. Abiotic factors, on the other hand, include non-living elements like climate, geography, and physical resources. Together, these factors contribute to the dynamic complexity of ecosystems, demanding species to continuously adapt for survival and reproduction.\nIn addition to these environmental factors, evolutionary processes are driven by a series of exogenous and endogenous dynamic forces, each with varying intensities and directional impacts. Exogenous forces originate from external sources beyond individual organisms or ecosystems, such as climatic fluctuations, geological events, and rare phenomena like asteroid impacts. These external influences exert significant effects on habitats, species distributions, and overall evolutionary trajectories by modifying environmental conditions and triggering evolutionary responses. Conversely, endogenous forces arise from within organisms or ecosystems or result from interactions among organisms. These forces encompass genetic mutations, physiological responses, and ecological interactions within populations or ecosystems, shaping genetic compositions and population dynamics over time. Environmental forces and conditions are pivotal in determining organism fitness, steering natural selection, and molding evolutionary paths. This process compels species to develop traits and behaviors tailored to their environmental niche, thereby increasing their chances of survival and reproductive success.\nBoth factors and forces coexist synergistically, each playing complementary roles: factors establish the foundational conditions and contexts for life, including environmental conditions and biological interactions, while forces actively drive evolutionary changes within these established contexts. Factors thus create the stage upon which evolutionary dynamics unfold, while forces shape the evolutionary paths by influencing genetic diversity and population-level adaptations over successive generations. Therefore, comprehending the complex interplay between environmental factors and dynamic forces is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving ecosystem evolution over time. This understanding is crucial for unraveling species adaptation, biodiversity patterns, and the resilience of ecosystems in response to environmental changes and disturbances.\nUltimately, the environment is bounded by its historical trajectory. Past events such as environmental disturbances and climatic shifts leave enduring impacts on ecosystems, influencing species composition, habitat availability, and biodiversity patterns. Ecosystems with long histories often exhibit greater biodiversity and genetic resilience, while disturbances can create legacies that restrict adaptation. Integrating historical perspectives into evolutionary analysis provides valuable insights into path-dependent processes, informing conservation strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem resilience.\n\n\n5.4.5 Phenotypic traits\nThe structural and behavioral traits of individual organisms are fundamental to evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. Structural traits include physical characteristics such as morphology, anatomy, and physiology, which determine an organism’s form and function. These traits are crucial for the adaptation of organisms to their environment and their interactions with other species. Behavioral traits, on the other hand, encompass actions and responses exhibited by organisms in their environment, including feeding behaviors, mating rituals, communication signals, and social interactions.\nThe interplay between structural and behavioral traits shapes the ecological niche occupied by organisms and determines their fitness within a given environment. Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the emergence, loss, or modification of traits, thereby shaping the organism’s overall adaptive strategy. By examining the morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations of organisms, valuable insights can be gained into the strategies employed by species, the dynamics of ecological communities, and the co-evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity over time.\n\n\n5.4.6 Adaptation\nAdaptation is a fundamental mechanism driving evolutionary change at the individual level within natural systems. Organisms continuously adjust their traits, behaviors, and physiological processes in response to selective pressures exerted by the environment. At its core, adaptation enables organisms to enhance their fitness and survival in specific ecological niches. Through the process of natural selection, individuals with traits that confer a reproductive advantage or improve survival under prevailing environmental conditions are more likely to pass on their genes to future generations. This process leads to the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, increasing their overall fitness and resilience to environmental challenges.\nAdaptation occurs through various mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, genetic mutations, and behavioral adjustments. Phenotypic plasticity allows traits to adjust to environmental cues, while mutations introduce genetic variation. Behavioral adaptations optimize resource use, predator avoidance, and reproduction. Understanding adaptation at the individual level is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and species diversification within natural systems. It can also shed light on species’ adaptive strategies, the emergence of novel traits, and the dynamics of ecological interactions along a period of time.\n\n\n5.4.7 Heredity\nHeredity refers to the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, playing a central role in evolutionary processes. Genetic material, encoded in DNA molecules, contains the instructions for an organism’s development, growth, and functioning. The mechanisms of heredity involve the replication and transmission of genetic material through processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Genetic variation arises from mutations, genetic recombination, and other mechanisms, leading to differences in traits among individuals within populations. Understanding heredity is essential for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change, as it influences the diversity, adaptation, and persistence of species over time.\nHeredity is linked to reproduction as it governs the transmission of genetic information from parent to offspring. This connection is vital because heredity, through the transmission of DNA, ensures the continuity of genetic traits across generations, providing the raw material for evolutionary change. Additionally, genetic variation resulting from mutations and recombination during reproduction introduces diversity within populations, fueling the process of natural selection and facilitating adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Thus, investigating the relationship between heredity and reproduction is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that underpin individual change processes and their broader implications for evolutionary dynamics within natural systems.\n\n\n5.4.8 Reproduction\nReproduction is a fundamental process driving evolutionary dynamics at the individual level. Through the production of offspring, organisms perpetuate their genetic lineage and pass on hereditary traits, ensuring the continuity of life and preserving genetic diversity within populations. Both sexual and asexual reproduction contribute to genetic variation, enriching the population’s genetic pool. Various factors, including mate choice, mating behaviors, reproductive timing, and reproductive success, influence the reproductive process, thereby impacting the genetic composition and evolutionary trajectory of species.\nModern evolutionary theory emphasizes reproductive success as the primary driver of selection, with the ability to transmit genetic information to offspring being paramount. This shift towards a focus on reproductive success has led to increased research on sexual selection and reproductive mechanisms, including the role of geographic barriers in species diversification. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for comprehending evolutionary processes in both natural and other systems. However, this perspective has faced criticism, notably from Stephen Jay Gould, who argued against it (2002). Ultimately, examining the reproductive process at the individual level is key to generating insights into the adaptive strategies employed by species, the preservation of genetic diversity, and the evolutionary forces influencing populations over time.\n\n\n5.4.9 Variation\nIn evolutionary science, “variation” refers to the diversity of traits and characteristics observed within populations, shaped by underlying genetic and environmental factors. Understanding variation is integral to the study of populations as it reveals the range of phenotypic and genotypic differences within and among species. Variation is intrinsically linked to competition and selection, as individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits to future generations. This differential reproductive success propagates favorable traits over successive generations, driving evolutionary change.\nMoreover, variation is closely connected to the concept of mutation, which introduces new genetic variants into populations. While not all mutations result in significant changes, with many being neutral, some can lead to notable phenotypic differences that may confer advantages or disadvantages. The evolutionary analyst will need to consider the role of the environment in determining which mutated traits spread within a population and which do not.\n\n\n5.4.10 Competition\nCompetition is a fundamental force driving evolutionary dynamics within natural systems. It arises when organisms vie for limited resources such as food, water, or territory. This competitive pressure favors traits that provide a competitive edge, leading to evolutionary changes over time and the inheritance of these beneficial traits by offspring. Within populations, competition manifests in various forms, including direct competition for resources, interference competition through aggressive interactions, and exploitative competition where one species outcompetes another for resources. These competitive interactions can lead to niche differentiation strategies, where species partition resources to reduce competition and coexist within the same habitat. Additionally, competition can drive evolutionary innovation and adaptation, as species evolve traits and behaviors to outcompete rivals. This dynamic can result in the diversification of species and the development of complex ecological interactions over evolutionary timescales.\nUltimately, competition sets the stage for natural selection to act. It results in the accumulation of adaptive traits within populations, while less advantageous traits are outcompeted and reduced in frequency. Understanding competition dynamics is therefore crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind species interactions, community dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories in natural ecosystems. Through the study of competitive interactions and their consequences, the evolutionary analyst can gain insights into the processes shaping biodiversity, ecological resilience, and ecosystem stability.\n\n\n5.4.11 Selection\nSelection mechanisms operate on the diversity of individual units, favoring traits that confer competitive advantages and improve survival. These processes are crucial drivers of evolutionary change. Natural selection, a primary mechanism, favors traits that improve an organism’s fitness and reproductive success in a given environment. Through this process, individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on their genetic material to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits within populations, driving evolutionary adaptation to changing environmental conditions.\nHowever, although natural selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, selection operates through various mechanisms, including directional selection, stabilizing selection, and disruptive selection. Directional selection shifts traits towards one extreme, stabilizing selection maintains the status quo within a population, and disruptive selection leads to divergence. Understanding these selection processes is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms driving evolutionary change and biodiversity within natural systems."

    "text": "4.5 Meta-Framework Synthesis(Data Extraction and Thematic Analysis)\nThe next stage involved a two-step process of data extraction and analysis from selected studies. First, a systematic data extraction process was undertaken that collected relevant information from the selected studies, including verbatim quotes and key findings supported by the study data. This allowed the capture of all information necessary to address the research questions, ultimately forming a robust empirical foundation for the construction of the meta-framework.\nAfter data extraction, all data were mapped and coded againts the a priori meta-framework established earlier. The process involved organizing the data in a meaningful manner to facilitate the identification of emerging patterns and relationships. Data coding was conducted thematically, adhering to the predefined themes identified within the a priori meta-framework, although the coding approach remained adaptable. Any relevant data that did not fit the themes of the a priori meta-framework were incorporated through an inductive approach. This allowed new themes and relationships to emerge from the data itself, ensuring the meta-analysis captured the full range of relevant information, even if it fell outside the a priori framework.\nTo enhance the rigor and efficiency of this process, qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti was employed. While Atlas.ti does not supplant the researcher’s critical role in data analysis and interpretation, it significantly bolsters the methodological rigor, efficiency, and overall quality of the research endeavor. Atlas.ti played a key role in streamlining data management and coding tasks while also facilitating visual analysis to identify patterns, themes, and relationships that might be less apparent through strictly textual methods."
