Se trata de un marco teórico que sirve de inspiración para afrontar una primera explicación o una ampliación de la explicación de un problema social complejo sin tener que recurrir a un largo proceso de construcción teórica. Esto no significa que la teoría biológica sea siempre asimilada por la económica, sino que esta última sirve como espejo sobre la que construir un andamiaje teórico de forma más robusta y rápida.\nBiology as a metaphora, esto nos permite mejorar la explicación de los fenómenos económicos y reforzar nuestros argumentos al utilizar cadenas causales que ya están investigadas y demostradas en biología\nBiology as a paradigm, nos permite enfrentar el análisis económico teniendo delante un marco causal ya demostrado que podamos usar como referencia, tanto en el uso de los conceptos como en los flujos de interacción entre ellos. Digamos que el análisis económico no parte de cero ni necesita inventar un adamiaje metodológico y conceptual cada vez, sino que podemos recurrrir a la biología para que nos aporte un marco de reflexión y pensamiento (que podemos ir adaptando a las estructuras y comportamientos que vamos descubriendo en economía) y que nos ahorra mucho tiempo y esfuerzo.\nBiology as a canvas to draw computational methods directamente aplicables a los procesos de resolución de problemas, i.e. captura de datos, modelos lógicos, procesamiento y funcionamiento de la información e interpretación de los resultados. Esto facilita y amplia nuestras capacidades a la hora de recurrir a herramientas que ya están diseñadas y han sido probadas en la resolución de problemas complejos y que podemos manipular y hacer crecer en un entorno computacional."

An analysis of the origin involves the need to explore for evidence of the past in search for a better system. The following are some of the theories to consider when addressing the problem of generation of the original structure:\n\nSpontaneous generation\nPreformationism (forms that are predetermined)\nPre-existence\nA mold that is fixed.\n\nWhen the evolutionary analyst deals with the problem of generation she must attend to the developmental process, and the constraints that it can impose on the rest of the evolutionary process. These constraints might introduce non-random variations, which can mean a way to direct. the course of evolution.\nIt is especially useful for the evolutionary analyst to consider that the unit (species) has a limited number of developmental pathways available and that the selection process would therefore be limited only to the possibility of tinkering with the details."

This question has historically been part of the discussion on evolutionary theory, with different approaches given by different authors.\nThe change driver, whether it is a single one or a set of drivers that configure the change process.\nThe mechanics of the process, whether gradual and slow, or sudden and in jumps, or any intermediate alternative in the continuum formed by these two extremes.\nThe time scale on which the change process takes place. This can develop over a vast amount of time or a small amount of time, or somewhere in between.\n\nSome important considerations to keep in mind are that the process of change always implies progress, but it can also involve regression."

    "text": "3.6 Reproduction\nCurrently there is a generalized consensus in accepting the reproductive success of the unit as the main driver of selection, that is, the ability to transmit the genetic load of the unit to the offspring. This modern vision of evolution has not always been like this, so less than 100 years ago success was considered to be found in the ability to adapt to the environment.\nSelection based on reproductive success has opened the doors to new avenues of interest and study, which now focus more on sexual selection, in the case of natural systems, or on the reproduction mechanisms of any other system.\nLet us also think that the selection process that takes place in the environment is continuous and is not interrupted even when the environment is stable. In other words, competition between some units and others for scarce resources never stops, even if the environment appears stable. The analogy of the Red Queen hypothesis, introduced by Van Halen Van Valen (2014) to denote that in the evolutionary race between organisms species must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their relative fitness within an ever-changing environment, it is good to explain that units must remain constantly improving or, otherwise, they will be outstripped by their rivals.\nThe notion of selection used in this paper is that of having a balance between different characters within a population and not about the development of a murderous or aggressive instinct.\n\n\n\n\nVan Valen, L. 2014. “19.

    "text": "4.1 On Evolution\nWhen addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what the unit of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied.\nThe analysis of evolutionary stratigraphy, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.\nThe geological law of superposition, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.\nOnce the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the hierarchical structure of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.\nWhen studying the evolution of a population, building a classification or taxonomy of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier for him to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through."

What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?\nPerhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.\nCan individual behavior be predicted? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.\nTo what extent can learning and technology affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?\nThe problem of hierarchy can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g. intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?\nIt is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to control genes and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)"

    "text": "4.6 On Change\nWe know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the historical past as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.\nIt is necessary to know which components of the individual’s structure (or flows) the forces of the environment act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.\nAlso relevant is the question of how the development process of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.\nDoes the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any goal or objective? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual’s process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g. a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?\nIn the analysis of evolutionary dynamics, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.\nWhat are the change mechanisms used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:\n\nHybridization\nRecombination\netc.\n\nTo what extent is the timeline for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.\nSpeaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary “clock” of the system, which would be the one that explains the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time. It is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.\nA possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as “punctuated equilibria.” According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis."

In other words, if it could be feasible to design your own plan and carry it out based on the knowledge generated about the evolution of the system.\nTo what extent is the system under observation random in change or does it evidence a logic that can be known and even altered based on our desires or needs?\n##Manipulation of the system and its programmability If they were really able to manipulate the system as we wish, on what elements would it be most feasible to do so? Would it be possible to act on both the structural and behavioral elements, only on one of them? Being able to act on a known evolutionary system would open new and great opportunities to design systems that meet a wide diversity of needs.\nThe above would necessarily entail having to assess the ethical problems of altering the course of nature and the new problems that would emerge by distorting the natural mechanisms of the functioning of life and society. The opposite position would be to conclude that the system is unalterable and we cannot intelligently design it to satisfy our desires.\nSociety would go from a stage in which social systems are considered elusive to another in which we would be able to know to what extent their evolution is random, to what extent there is causality and to what extent they are programmable."

In fact, the process of replacement or extinction of species is an essential aspect to understand human progress.\nThe level at which the analyst expects to inform policy, or the level of contribution expected by decision makers from an evolutionary model, is a factor in determining the level of analysis to be used in the “struggle for existence.”"
