# Analogies

## Why Analogies?
"The purpose of analogical reasoning in which we consciously and systematically apply the explanation of one series of events to another very different series of events is to help us better to understand the nature of the latter, which presumably is less well understood than the former. If the analogy has really helpful explanatory value, there must be some reason for believing that the two series of events have enough in common for the explanation of one, mutatis mutandis, to provide at least a partial explanation of the other. This type of analogy must be distinguished from the purely metaphorical analogy in which the resemblances between two phenomena are used to add a picturesque note to an otherwise dull analysis and to help a reader to see more clearly the outlines of a process being described by enabling him to draw on what he knows in order to imagine the unknown. Analogies of this sort are not only useful but almost indispensable to human thought." [@penrose1952biological]

## Main Types of Biological Analogies

"Biological analogies in particular have been widely used in discussions of the firm. Probably the best known and most common of these analogies is that of the **life cycle**, in which the appearance, growth and disappearance of firms is likened to the processes of birth, growth, and death of biological organisms. Marshall's reference to the rise and fall of the trees in the forest is an oft-quoted example of this type of analogy." [@penrose1952biological]

"Recently, two additional biological analogies have been presented -**a natural selection analogy**, dubbed by one writer viability analysis, and the **homeostasis analogy** designed to explain some aspects of the behavior of firms. The former, like the life cycle analogy, is for use in long-run analysis only. The latter is exclusively for short-run analyIn summary, this book has no content whatsoever. Both are supposed to represent improvements on the existing theory of the firm at the core of which lies the chief target of attack - the assumption that firms attempt to maximize profit" [@penrose1952biological]

"The chief danger of carrying sweeping analogies very far is that the problems they are designed to illuminate become framed in such a special way that significant matters are frequently inadvertently obscured. Biological analogies contribute little either to the theory of price or to the theory of growth and development of firms and in general tend to confuse the nature of the important issues." [@penrose1952biological]

## The "Life Cycle" Theory of the Firm (Kenneth Boulding)
"Implicit in the notion that firms have a "life cycle" analogous to that of living organisms is the idea that there are "laws" governing the development of firms akin to the laws of nature in accordance with which living organisms appear to grow, and that the different stages of development are a function of age." [@penrose1952biological]

"The purposes a life cycle theory of the firm would serve are obvious, yet the theory as a bare undeveloped hypothesis has existed for a long time and nothing has been done to construct from it a consistent theoretical system with sufficient content to enable it to be used for any purpose whatsoever. The basic hypothesis is not one from which sig- nificant logical consequences can be deduced, such as can be deduced,' for example, from the proposition that firms attempt to maximize prof- its. Supplementary hypotheses about the kind of organism the firm is and the nature of its life cycle are required. Although we have a re- spectable collection of information about firms, it has not stimulated economists even to suggest the further hypotheses necessary to the de- velopment of a life cycle theory of the firm. This, I think, is primarily because the available evidence does not support the theory that firms have a life cycle characterized by a consistent transition through recog- nizable stages of development similar to those of living organisms. In- deed, just the opposite conclusion must be drawn: the development of firms does not proceed according to the same "grim" laws as does that of living organisms. In the face of the evidence one is led to wonder why the analogy persists and why there is still a demand for a life cycle theory of the firm" [@penrose1952biological].
