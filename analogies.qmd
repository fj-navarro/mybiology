# Analogies

## Why Analogies?
"The purpose of analogical reasoning in which we consciously and systematically apply the explanation of one series of events to another very different series of events is to help us better to understand the nature of the latter, which presumably is less well understood than the former. If the analogy has really helpful explanatory value, there must be some reason for believing that the two series of events have enough in common for the explanation of one, mutatis mutandis, to provide at least a partial explanation of the other. This type of analogy must be distinguished from the purely metaphorical analogy in which the resemblances between two phenomena are used to add a picturesque note to an otherwise dull analysis and to help a reader to see more clearly the outlines of a process being described by enabling him to draw on what he knows in order to imagine the unknown. Analogies of this sort are not only useful but almost indispensable to human thought.The biological analogies of the firm are not of this metaphorical type or there would be no call to push them into service to help explain the development of firms" [@penrose1952biological]

"In the notion that a firm is an organism akin to biological organisms, there is an implication that, since all such organisms have something in common, we can use our knowledge of biological organisms to gain more insight into the firm" [@penrose1952biological]

"The characteristic use of biological analogies in economics is to suggest explanations of events that do not depend upon the conscious willed decisions of human beings. This is not, of course, characteristic of biology as such, for some branches of biology are concerned with learning processes and decision making, with purposive motivation and conscious choice in men as well as animals. In this, biology overlaps sociology and psychology and, in a sense, even economics. Information drawn from these branches of biology can be useful in helping us to understand the behavior of men and consequently of the institutions men create and operate. **In using such information, however, we are not dealing with analogies at all, but with essentially the same problems on a more complex scale**. But, paradoxically, where explicit biological analogies crop up in economics they are drawn exclusively from that aspect of biology which deals with the non-motivated behavior of organisms or in which motivation does not make any difference." [@penrose1952biological]. The use value of the biological analogy is found not in its metaphorical value, nor even in the use of the analogy itself, but in that it constitutes the lower level of the complex analysis suite from which emanates the behavior of individuals and the societies at a much higher level of analysis.
 
## Main Types of Biological Analogies

"Biological analogies in particular have been widely used in discussions of the firm. Probably the best known and most common of these analogies is that of the **life cycle**, in which the appearance, growth and disappearance of firms is likened to the processes of birth, growth, and death of biological organisms. Marshall's reference to the rise and fall of the trees in the forest is an oft-quoted example of this type of analogy." [@penrose1952biological]

"Recently, two additional biological analogies have been presented -**a natural selection analogy**, dubbed by one writer viability analysis, and the **homeostasis analogy** designed to explain some aspects of the behavior of firms. The former, like the life cycle analogy, is for use in long-run analysis only. The latter is exclusively for short-run analyIn summary, this book has no content whatsoever. Both are supposed to represent improvements on the existing theory of the firm at the core of which lies the chief target of attack - the assumption that firms attempt to maximize profit" [@penrose1952biological]

"The chief danger of carrying sweeping analogies very far is that the problems they are designed to illuminate become framed in such a special way that significant matters are frequently inadvertently obscured. Biological analogies contribute little either to the theory of price or to the theory of growth and development of firms and in general tend to confuse the nature of the important issues." [@penrose1952biological]

## The "Life Cycle" Theory of the Firm (Kenneth Boulding)
"Implicit in the notion that firms have a "life cycle" analogous to that of living organisms is the idea that there are "laws" governing the development of firms akin to the laws of nature in accordance with which living organisms appear to grow, and that the different stages of development are a function of age." [@penrose1952biological]

"The purposes a life cycle theory of the firm would serve are obvious, yet the theory as a bare undeveloped hypothesis has existed for a long time and nothing has been done to construct from it a consistent theoretical system with sufficient content to enable it to be used for any purpose whatsoever. The basic hypothesis is not one from which significant logical consequences can be deduced, such as can be deduced,' for example, from the proposition that firms attempt to maximize profits. Supplementary hypotheses about the kind of organism the firm is and the nature of its life cycle are required. Although we have a respectable collection of information about firms, it has not stimulated economists even to suggest the further hypotheses necessary to the development of a life cycle theory of the firm. This, I think, is primarily because the available evidence does not support the theory that firms have a life cycle characterized by a consistent transition through recognizable stages of development similar to those of living organisms. Indeed, just the opposite conclusion must be drawn: the development of firms does not proceed according to the same "grim" laws as does that of living organisms. In the face of the evidence one is led to wonder why the analogy persists and why there is still a demand for a life cycle theory of the firm" [@penrose1952biological].

"Clearly the one thing a firm does not have in common with biological organisms is a genetic constitution, and yet this is the one factor that determines the life cycle of biological organisms." [@penrose1952biological] In this regard, see the use of the genetic analogy with Nelson and Winter's @nelson1985evolutionary statement about what constitutes the genetic basis of the firm by assimilating it to the skills and abilities they have and that are transmitted from one employee to another.

"We have no reason whatsoever for thinking that the growth pattern of a biological organism is willed by the organism itself. On the other hand, we have every reason for thinking that the growth of a firm is willed by those who make the decisions of the firm and are themselves part of the firm, and the proof of this lies in the fact that no one can describe the development of any given firm or explain how it came to be the size it is except in terms of decisions taken by individual men" [@penrose1952biological]. Note that tThis conflicts with the perspective provided by Alchian @alchian1950uncertainty, according to which the behavior of the firm has an adoptive part (not linked to the will of the units that make the decisions in the firm), and another adaptive part (which does depend on the willpower).

"There can be no doubt, I think, that to liken a firm to an organism and then attempt to explain its growth by reference to the laws of growth of biological organisms is an ill-founded procedure (...) besides being ill- founded, this type of reasoning about the firm obscures, if it does not implicitly deny, the fact that firms are institutions created by men to serve the purposes of men.It can be admitted that to some extent firms operate automatically in accordance with the principles governing the mechanism constructed, but to abandon their development to the laws of nature diverts attention from the importance of human decisions and motives, and from problems of ethics and public policy, and surrounds the whole question of the growth of the firm with an aura of "naturalness" and even inevitability."
