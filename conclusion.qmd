# Conclusion

The evolutionary analysis of systems fundamentally requires generating much more extensive and precise knowledge about individuals and populations, as well as about the periods and places in which they develop. This is self-evident when it comes to obtaining a deeper understanding of the reasons for change and diversity.

We also know today that systems do not evolve smoothly and continuously over long periods of time but do so based on pulses between periods of interruption that cause disruptive changes and the mass extinction of units.

Knowing the sequence of events that have shaped the evolutionary processes opens new analytical dimensions to the study of the evolutionary phenomenon and allows us to confront elements considered unpredictable until now in the course of evolution.
