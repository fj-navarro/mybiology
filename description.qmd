# Description

It is important to clearly establish the differences that distinguish an evolutionary process from another of change or transformation. Although these are related concepts in evolutionary theory, they actually denote different processes that act on different agents, which is why they tend to be confusing even among some specialists.

Evolution is an overarching process that drives change in populations over generations. This means that evolutionary processes do not operate at the level of a specific individual or organism, which would only change or transform. Evolution therefore represents the cumulative effect of the inherited changes made by the characteristics of the individuals of a population, on which a selection process operates affecting the frequency of traits within a population over time. Change encompasses a broad spectrum of morphological or behavioral alterations within individuals from a variety of factors, including environmental pressures and reproductive patterns. Transformation suggests more profound or significant shifts in form, structure or function of individuals.

## Evolution
In the process of evolution is worth consider the role of **feedback loops** between mental an social evolution (as imagined by H.Spencer). For this author a more complex society is a stimulus for more mental development. This is the foundation of evolutionary psychology and of sociobiology.

How is the mechanism of evolution: **cyclic vs. continuous**?

The role of the organism to focus in new habits and become an **active creative agent** in charge of its own destiny is an idea of H.Spencer.This takes the evolutionary analyst to think about the role of **knowledge** and **learning** to change habits and create new instincts, in the end, to unfold a process of self-improvement (which is Lamarckian).

### Competition
The evolutionary analyst must understand **competition** as that within an **ecology** based on **struggle**. These are three fundamental terms to understand the evolutionary analysis framework.


## Origin

The problem of the origin is associated with that of the "Problem of Generation" and its accompanying theories of generation. An analysis of the origin involves the need to explore for evidence of the past in search for a better system. The following are some of the theories to consider when addressing the problem of generation of the original structure:

-   Spontaneous generation

-   Preformationism (forms that are predetermined)

-   Pre-existence

-   A mold that is fixed.

When the evolutionary analyst deals with the problem of generation she must attend to the *developmental process*, and the constraints that it can impose on the rest of the evolutionary process. These constraints might introduce non-random variations, which can mean a way to direct. the course of evolution.

It is especially useful for the evolutionary analyst to consider that the unit (species) has a limited number of developmental pathways available and that the selection process would therefore be limited only to the possibility of tinkering with the details.

## Structure

The main issue when considering Structure is to establish what the analytical unit of the system is (and what its main basic components are). In the case of natural evolutionary theory, this unit has traditionally been the organism, but also the population and later, after modern synthesis, the gene. It is the analyst's job to determine as clearly as possible which is the "unit" on which the evolutionary analysis of the system will focus.

## Environment

The environment surrounding the chosen unit of analysis exerts various types of forces that act on the structure to provoke a process of change, with greater or lesser intensity, and in one direction or another.

The forces of change originating in the environment force the unit to change, so it is essential that the analyst analyze the environment in depth as a key impact driver, understanding the role of the environment in the evolutionary process of the system.

The connection between the environment and the origin is a key issue as well, since the direction of the change, if it exists, and the intensity or depth of the change that may take place in the structure of the unit may sometimes depend on it.

It is important when analyzing the environment to specify the type of force applied to the structure, and its sources in said environment.

### Selection
Is (natural) selection an **episodic or a continuous** process? 

Are there periods of stable life where (natural) selection does not operate? or, Is (natural selection) always operating even in a stable environment?

A related approach is the one which considers **selectionism vs. saltationism**, and the extension with the role of mass extinctions. This would open the debate about evolution not always being progressive, and the acceptance that species could **degenerate** in less challenging lifestyle.

Is the (social) behavior programmed into us by natural selection? This would take us to the question of the **development of social instincts**. 

The idea of struggle and death might have a positive purpose to keep species well adapted to a challenging environment (this is an utilitarian perspective). They might have a creative role (along with sex reproduction). 

How evolution can produce **advance in several directions** (and not only towards humanity)?

## Behavior

Behavior is the way in which the structure articulates a response to the pressure exerted by environmental forces. Behavior establishes the boundaries within which the structure is capable of absorbing the forces of the environment and giving an adaptive response to the new situation or challenge posed by the environment.

The result of the behavior, which takes place within the boundaries established by the structure of the unit, can give rise to three types of adaptive responses by the system:

-   New system qualities (traits)
-   Loss of system qualities (traits)
-   Modification of system qualities (traits)

## Change

Both the structure and the behavior are permanently immersed in a process of change, since the unit is always sensitive to the forces exerted on it originating in the environment. The overall evolutionary process of the unit will depend on the way in which these forces affect the unit.

The characterization of the change process must be carried out considering the following key dimensions, all of them closely related:

1.  The direction or trend of the change process. This question has historically been part of the discussion on evolutionary theory, with different approaches given by different authors.

2.  The change driver, whether it is a single one or a set of drivers that configure the change process.

3.  The mechanics of the process, whether gradual and slow, or sudden and in jumps, or any intermediate alternative in the continuum formed by these two extremes.

4.  The time scale on which the change process takes place. This can develop over a vast amount of time or a small amount of time, or somewhere in between.

Some important considerations to keep in mind are that the process of change always implies progress, but it can also involve regression.

**Mutations** play a role in the process of change, specifically they provide a source of random variation, but they do not generate new species. It must be taken into account that not all genes that undergo a mutation produce drastic changes in the organism (individual); in reality, most mutations are neutral and do not produce noticeable changes. The evolutionary analyst will have to take into account that the environment plays a role in determining which mutated characters are those that spread in the population (this is nothing more than the phenomenon of **selection**).

Maybe the concept of mutation is for more drastic transformations leading to new species, accepting that adaptation and selection might be irrelevant.

Can the evolutionary analyst evaluate the idea that there might be **internal forces** generating characters unrelated to the organism's needs? A related consideration may take us to consider that evolutionary changes occur in a predetermined manner driven by internal factors (this is called "directed evolution"). This is what has historically been called **orthogenesis** (F.Eimer).

The above opens involves **fixity** of direction, and if variation is also considered as not random, therefore there is no need for adaptation. According to this vision the environment would not have any role in evolution. Evolution might come to happen beyond what is functionally needed and not because environmental factors.

Does **"overdevelopment theory"** apply (A.Hyatt)?

## Reproduction

Currently there is a generalized consensus in accepting the **reproductive success** of the unit as the main driver of selection, that is, the ability to transmit the genetic load of the unit to the offspring (this perspective has been criticised by Stephen Jay Gould). This modern vision of evolution has not always been like this, so less than 100 years ago success was considered to be found in the ability to adapt to the environment.

Selection based on reproductive success has opened the doors to new avenues of interest and study, which now focus more on sexual selection, in the case of natural systems, or on the **reproduction** mechanisms of any other system. An interesting factor that every evolutionary analyst may want to analyze is the role of **geographic barriers** to explain the way in which species multiply.

Let us also think that the selection process that takes place in the environment is continuous and is not interrupted even when the environment is stable. In other words, competition between some units and others for scarce resources never stops, even if the environment appears stable. The analogy of the **Red Queen hypothesis**, introduced by Van Halen @van201419 to denote that in the evolutionary race between organisms species must constantly adapt and evolve just to maintain their relative fitness within an ever-changing environment, it is good to explain that units must remain constantly improving or, otherwise, they will be outstripped by their rivals.

The notion of selection used in this paper is that of having a balance between different characters within a population and not about the development of a murderous or aggressive instinct.

### Speciation and Specialization

The problem of **speciation**, that is, the division of a parent into several descendants. This is related to niche **specialization** and **adaptation**. Speciation is a fundamental mechanism of **biological diversification**.

Speciation leads to opportunities for specialization. Specialization within populations can contribute to reproductive isolation and promote speciation. It can also drive specialized traits that lead to divergence of populations over time.

In specialization a constant force, natural selection, determines the level of specialization, posing a pressure to specialize on species (in line with Adam Smith thought). The level of specialization influences the level of adaptation, which drives a divergent process of speciation. 

**Types of specialization**: genetic, behavioral or ecological.

**Role of geographical isolation of speciation**
There are two considerations in regards of the role of geographical isolation for speciation. One considers that specialization emerges without the need of geographical barriers, this is called **sympatric speciation** and is a radiply evolving type of speciation. Whereas **allopatric speciation** is much less rapid and more accepted today, and considers geographical barriers at the initial stage of species separation.



## Heredity
Species have a **gene pool** that contain a large pool of genetic variability, in which many of these genes are simply useless or harmful. This gene pool is the raw material for **selection**.

An important task of the evolutionary analyst will be to determine if there are **modifier genes** (W.Castle) that influence the genes responsible for phenotypic characters.

Some Lamarckian stances might be worth an analysis. For example, the evolutionary analyst might consider that not all **inherited acquired characteristics (IAC)** are inherited by or as a response to changes in the environment.

The above might take of to the question if all evolution is mere **trial-and-error**, and how much is a **deliberate choice** of new habits in response to changes in the environment? Current thinking considers that not all needs to be inherited, so (to what extent) Can the environment influence heredity? (W.Bateson). But be advised that genetics is hostile to this idea.

**Mendelian rule** of "one single unit" in the germ plasm being responsible for determining the character and transmitting it to offspring. This would lead us to have to elucidate which genes (alleles) are dominant and which are recessive. This would lead us to have to elucidate which genes (alleles) are dominant and which are recessive, and thus explain that there are discontinuous characters (Bateson).
