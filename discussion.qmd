## On Evolution

When addressing the study of an evolutionary system, it is of paramount importance to first elucidate what **the unit** of the system will be, on which the entire conceptual and methodological apparatus of evolution will be applied. This is a discussion that has changed over time, having moved from the individual organism to what is currently considered a more correct approach, the gene. What the above means is that instead of prioritizing "adaptive fitness" in the analysis, today it seems more appropriate to focus on the reproductive success of the individual. This new perspective has given rise to the movement of ultra-Darwinism.

The analysis of evolutionary **stratigraphy**, that is, the analysis of the evolutionary process cut into layers, can provide valuable evidence and insight about the evolution followed by each stratum, as well as the relationships that exist between strata. Additionally, it may also be valuable to study the global stratigraphy of the system, that is, the system of layers resulting from aggregating lower-level strata into higher-level strata, since this can suggest new stratal relationships that previously remained hidden from view of the evolutionary system.

The geological **law of superposition**, which states that in any sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks, each layer of rock is younger than the one below it and older than the one above it, can be used analogously in the analysis of an evolutionary system, thus establishing that each lower layer manifests a behavior on which the behavior of the upper layer is based.

Once the evolutionary system has been sliced into strata and the evidence that each one individually provides, as well as that of the global stratigraphic system, has been analyzed, the evolutionary analyst will be able to infer the **hierarchical structure** of evolutionary elements that characterize the system under observation.

When studying the evolution of a population, building a **classification or taxonomy** of units (species) becomes relevant. This requires discipline and deep analysis into the building blocks and the relationships (or degrees of relationships) that stand between individuals. By formulating a classification/taxonomy, new avenues can be opened that allow the evolutionary analyst to trace (and understand) the past of the units and make it easier for him to foresee the next steps that the unit will go through.

The idea of the extent to which the **history of "life"** has been progressive but in an irregular way.

The idea of **"emergent evolution"** (Lloyd Morgan) which highlights the new high-level properties that appear as evolution reaches a certain level of complexity.

## On the Origin

The idea of the Origin is consubstantially associated with the idea of an **end**, since everything that begins must necessarily have an end.

The problem of origin is closed related to the **problem of generation**, thus the evolutionary analyst must elucidate whether the origin of the unit is spontaneous, preformationist, etc.

An alternative perspective to the problem of origin can be raised from **biogenesis** (life arising from non-living matter) and the **"primordial soup"** (Opsin), that is, the combination of elements that gives rise to the synthesis of compounds " organic" after adding energy to the system (from lightning, UVA radiation, volcanic activity, etc.)



## On the Environment

### On the Forces

We do not know the forces (and their sources) that operate driving the process of change in the individuals of a population.

Apart from the forces that operate at the level of individuals, it is necessary to know what the transmission mechanisms are like from the environment to the individual, between individuals, and vice versa, from the individual to the environment.

What is the materiality of the pressure for change exerted by an environmental force?

### On Selection

One of the most difficult questions that every evolutionary analyst must face is how the **selection process** imposed by the environment actually work, and to what extent different alternative selection approaches can help explain the evolutionary course of the system.

We refer to the selection process not as the blind application of a closed paradigm that we know a priori will provide an explanatory response to the evolution of any system, but rather the analyst evaluates to what degree alternative selection models can provide insight into our understanding of the evolution of the system. It is about better understanding how rival visions can have a place in our understanding of the evolutionary phenomena of the system, even in an open and simultaneous way.

## On the Structure

## On the Behavior

To what extent is the system's behavior governed by inherited **instincts**? And to what extent can the selection process alter instincts? Are instincts constraints to the development of behavior and the process of change, or are they not such constraints?

What behavioral traits can be considered **innate** and which are constructed with the interaction with the natural and social environment? What are the environmental stimuli that might help explain the individual instincts?

Perhaps the analyst, in addition to (the above) behavioralist approach, might approach the analysis of the behavior by exploring the internal processes inside the individual that trigger observable responses in the individual.

Can individual behavior be **predicted**? Furthermore, can behavior be controlled by manipulating the environment and creating a stimulus-response association in the individual? The evolutionary analyst might also focus on how the individual learns through the association of stimuli with specific responses.

To what extent can **learning** and **technology** affect instincts to the point of making them heritable?

The problem of **hierarchy** can also affect behavior to the point that the evolutionary analyst can try to elucidate what the behavioral hierarchy is (e.g. intellectual, social, moral, etc.). How are these behavioral faculties created?

It is important for the evolutionary analyst to assess to what extent there is the possibility that we have the ability to **control genes** and, therefore, that we can control how human behavior can be controlled (The Blind Watchmaker- R.Dawkins)

## On Change

We know what an individual is today, but we do not know how an individual became what it is today. This necessarily raises the need to study the **historical past** as a source of knowledge to understand the process of change or evolution followed.

It is necessary to know which components of the individual's structure (or flows) the **forces of the environment** act on, or on which behaviors the forces of the environment have an impact.

Also relevant is the question of how the **development process** of an individual is like, both before conception (embryonic development) and during its life period.

Does the change caused by forces in the environment respond to any **goal or objective**? Is there any direction, goal or trend? And if there is one, what is the justification for it to exist? Is there any type of constraint associated with the development of the individual that conditions or limits the process of change? Can we rule out that the individual's process of change does not have a teleological character (e.g. a guiding principle, a force, etc.) towards a specific end/goal?

In the analysis of **evolutionary dynamics**, it is interesting to know if the system becomes stable and in equilibrium, stable and not in equilibrium. Finding out this situation allows us to better understand the nature of the evolutionary process and try to predict the next steps in the evolution of the system.

What are the **change mechanisms** used by units to respond to environmental forces? Some may be:

1)  Hybridization
2)  Recombination
3)  etc.

To what extent is the **timeline** for the adoption of changes a key factor that determines the individual results of the change? When analyzing change it is key therefore key to elucidate the timeline in which it unfolds.

Speaking about the timescale of the change processes, it is interesting to find out if the system is constrained by certain structural limitations, or that they have their origin in its own development, and that explain why the changes occur. This would allow the evolutionary analyst to estimate the particular evolutionary **"clock"** of the system. The idea of the clock is to explain traits that evolve at a constant rate overtime, due to underlying molecular mechanisms. In other words, that would explain the rate of change at which changes accumulate over time. 

It is evident that the clock idea would not offer precise information similar to that currently used in the field of molecular biology or genetics to provide insight into the the tempo and mode of evolutionary change, but it could be a qualitative approximation to the temporal factors that intervene in the rate of evolution of a system.

A possible model that explains the evolutionary process that should be seriously taken into account is known as **punctuated equilibria"**. According to this model, species remain relatively stable and in equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. During this time they register small changes in their morphology or level of adaptation. However, at certain times, sudden changes occur that trigger evolutionary episodes of changes (punctuation) associated with events that are accompanied by speciation. These periods of rapid change would be interspersed with long periods of stasis.
