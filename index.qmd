# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Evolutionary economics, especially in its endeavor to elucidate the behavior of firms, confronts notable integrative challenges that have constrained its ascension as a mainstream alternative within economics vis-Ã -vis classical paradigms. Central among these challenges are the dispersion, fragmentation, and reductionism inherent in the accumulation of knowledge. Nevertheless, the integration of evolutionary knowledge stands as a main driver for disciplinary advancement, offering a pathway to holistic comprehension, innovation stimulation, methodological enhancement, and improved applicability in policy and practice domains. In response to these impediments, a meta-framework for knowledge integration has been formulated. Rooted in foundational tenets derived from evolutionary biology, evolutionary economics, and firm-specific research, this integrated approach seeks to furnish deeper insights into the complex dynamics governing firms, while providing a more cohesive and structured comprehension of firm evolution by transcending disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes by outlining the implications of this meta-framework for scholarly inquiry and practical application, while identifying prospective avenues for future research.
