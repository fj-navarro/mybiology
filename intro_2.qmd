*0. Introduction / 0.1 Background / 0.2 Purpose of the European ICT Skills Meta-Framework @de2006european*

*A Meta-Framework is one which stands beyond (or above) (other) frameworks, in the sense of describing (other) frameworks. A Meta-Framework is a framework about frameworks. There are a number of existing frameworks for ICT Practitioners within the EU and beyond, and the proposed Meta-Framework would "stand beyond" them in particular because it is not intended, or designed, to stand alongside them.* *It is not a "new" ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence Framework, but attempts to encompass and disseminate information about existing (and possible future) such frameworks, for the benefit of all.\@de2006european*

*Better understanding about ICT Skills can be useful in a number of ways, but extensive discussions as part of the Workshop process have concluded that the greatest value from this Meta-Framework can be gained from its use as:*

*• a tool for structured comparison between existing ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence Frameworks;* *• a guidance resource on which those considering the possibility of developing their own Frameworks can draw;* *• a conceptual basis for planning future developments that would help assure a greater supply of competent ICT Practitioners to European employers; and* *• a starting point from which the proposed European Qualifications Framework can be applied to, and evaluated for, ICT Practitioner work, both by employers and by practitioners planning their careers.\@de2006european*

*Just as Information and Communication Technologies themselves are highly complex and continuing to evolve, so the skill-sets needed in relation to deploying and using ICT are both very complex and not yet stable or mature in terms of coherence of their classification. As a result, efforts to clarify and codify the structures of these skills have not yet reached a level of stability that enables adequate agreement at the European level on classification frameworks that could be thought of as a possible future standard for the European Union.\@de2006european*

*The need for such a review was recognised in light of an effectiveness review of interventions promoting a shift away from car travel towards more active modes of transport, the 'modal shift' review (Ogilvie et al., 2004).This found equivocal evidence of effectiveness for population-level interventions that promote walking and cycling as alternatives to car use (...) Synthesising views studies and effectiveness studies together can lead to more specific recommendations for developing interventions, choosing which to evaluate rigorously, as well as which to implement as policy. @brunton2006synthesis*

*Synthesising these findings with the 'modal shift' review's effectiveness findings identified some interventions that are appropriate and effective; and some that may be promising either because they appear effective in some studies, but not others, or because they complement people's views, but have not been rigorously evaluated for their effects. Effective interventions to be adapted for wider use include social marketing, with and without the development of cycle networks.\@brunton2006synthesis*

*Studies of people's views have several implications for intervention. The most important is the need to reduce the convenience of car travel and simultaneously increase the safety of pedestrians and cyclists in residential areas and around schools. According to the research evidence, this would encourage children, young people and parents to walk and cycle, and to use public spaces more, which would strengthen overall community environments.\@brunton2006synthesis*

## History

The concept of evolution, in the sense of a gradual development or change over time, has been a subject of contemplation and inquiry for civilizations throughout history. While ancient civilizations may not have had access to the scientific methods and knowledge that underpin modern evolutionary theory, they did observe and speculate about patterns of change in the natural world. For example:

1.  **Ancient Greece**: The ancient Greek philosophers contemplated the origins and development of life, the diversity of species, and the process of change in the natural world, proposing early ideas that laid the groundwork for later theories of evolution. The pre-Socratic philosofer Anaximander proposed a theory of evolution where life originated from a primordial substance, the "apeiron", which evolved over time through a process of spontaneous generation and transformation. He speculated that simpler forms of life gave rise to more complex organisms, anticipating the idea of a progression or development of species. Almost one hundred years later, Empedocles in his *Theory of the Four Elements* proposed that all matter was composed of four fundamental elements - earth, air, fire, and water. He suggested that living organisms arose from combinations of these elements, hinting at a process of transformation and change over time.

2.  **Aristotle (384 -- 322 BCE)**: Aristotle proposed a scala naturae (Great Chain of Being), which depicted a hierarchical order of existence with all living beings arranged in a graded scale from simple to complex. While not a theory of biological evolution, Aristotle's ideas influenced later thinkers and shaped medieval and early modern views of nature. Atomist philosophers such as Leucippus and his student Democritus proposed a materialistic view of the universe, suggesting that all phenomena could be explained in terms of interactions between atoms. While their ideas differed from modern evolutionary theory, their emphasis on naturalistic explanations contributed to humanity's ongoing quest to understand the origins and development of life on Earth, and opened the possibility of variation and change in living organisms.

3.  **Ancient India and China**: Ancient Indian and Chinese philosophies also explored ideas related to the origins and development of life. For instance, Hindu and Buddhist cosmologies include concepts of cyclical time and reincarnation, which imply a process of change and evolution, and they are early attempts to understand the natural world and humanity's place within it. While not explicitly addressing biological evolution, Daoist texts such as the "Zhuangzi" and the "Dao De Jing" contained passages that reflected a cyclical view of time and the continuous transformation of the natural world. Central to the Chinese cosmology is the Yin-yang theory, which posited the dynamic interplay between opposing forces. This concept of balance and change informed Chinese views of the natural world, including notions of growth, decay, and cyclical renewal. While early Buddhist texts did not discuss biological evolution, the idea of continual change and the cycle of birth and rebirth suggested a broader understanding of evolutionary processes. Hindu cosmology, as outlined in texts such as the "Puranas" and the "Bhagavad Gita," described cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth spanning vast epochs of time. The concept of "yugas" or cosmic ages implied a process of change and evolution within the universe.

4.  **Islamic Golden Age**: During the Islamic Golden Age, scholars like Al-Jahiz in the 9th century proposed a rudimentary form of natural selection in his work "Kitab al-Hayawan" (Book of Animals), where he speculated about how organisms compete for resources and adapt to their environments, suggesting that those best suited to their surroundings are more likely to survive and reproduce. Muslim philosophers such as Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Avicenna (Ibn Sina), and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) engaged in philosophical speculation and inquiry, drawing upon Greek, Persian, and Indian sources. They explored concepts such as the eternity of the universe, the nature of causality, and the possibility of spontaneous generation. Islamic scholars, including physicians, astronomers, and natural philosophers, observed and studied the natural world, including plants, animals, and celestial phenomena. While their inquiries focused primarily on practical and empirical aspects of nature, they contributed to a broader understanding of the diversity and complexity of life.

5.  **Indigenous Cultures**: Indigenous cultures around the world often developed rich and diverse cosmologies, creation myths, and oral traditions that reflected their understanding of the origins and development of life, and about the diversity of species. These stories usually include elements of change, adaptation, and transformation over time, and offer unique insights into humanity's relationship with the natural world. Many indigenous cultures viewed time as cyclical rather than linear, with recurring patterns of creation, destruction, and renewal. This cyclical perspective encompasses the idea of continual change and transformation in the natural world, including the evolution of species over time. Some indigenous cultures have interpreted fossils, geological formations, and natural phenomena in ways that reflect their cosmological beliefs and spiritual worldviews. These interpretations differ from Western scientific explanations but provide cultural perspectives on the history and diversity of life on Earth.

While these historical perspectives on evolution greatly differ from modern scientific understanding, they reflect humanity's curiosity and attempts to make sense of the natural world and its processes of change. The development of modern evolutionary theory represents a culmination of centuries of scientific inquiry, observation, and experimentation, building upon and refining earlier ideas and insights.

In the centuries preceding Charles Darwin's formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection, several thinkers proposed ideas and concepts that contributed to the development of evolutionary thought. Some of the main thinkers of evolution in pre-Darwinian times include:

3.  **Lucretius (c. 99 -- c. 55 BCE)**: A Roman poet and philosopher, Lucretius wrote "De Rerum Natura" (On the Nature of Things), in which he espoused a form of atomism and proposed ideas about the origins and development of life through natural processes.

4.  **Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707 -- 1788)**: Buffon, a French naturalist, proposed theories of transmutation and transformation of species in his work "Histoire Naturelle" (Natural History). He suggested that environmental influences could lead to changes in organisms over time.

5.  **Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 -- 1829)**: Lamarck, a French naturalist, proposed a theory of evolution based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He suggested that organisms could change over time in response to environmental pressures, and these acquired traits could be passed on to offspring.

6.  **Erasmus Darwin (1731 -- 1802)**: Erasmus Darwin, an English physician, naturalist, and grandfather of Charles Darwin, proposed evolutionary ideas in his work "Zoonomia" and other writings. He suggested that life evolved from simpler to more complex forms through a process of gradual transformation.

These thinkers and others contributed to the development of evolutionary thought in pre-Darwinian times, laying the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection in the 19th century. While their ideas differed from modern evolutionary theory, they reflected early attempts to understand the origins and development of life on Earth.

In the centuries preceding the formulation of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, various ideas and concepts about the origins and development of life were proposed by philosophers, theologians, and naturalists. These pre-Darwinian ideas laid the groundwork for later evolutionary theories. Some of the main ideas about evolution in pre-Darwinian times include:

1.  **Great Chain of Being**: The concept of the Great Chain of Being, prevalent in ancient Greek, Roman, and medieval Christian thought, posited a hierarchical order of existence, with God at the pinnacle and all living beings arranged in a graded scale from simple to complex. While not a theory of biological evolution, it implied a continuum of life forms and the potential for change over time within a fixed, predetermined framework.

2.  **Transformational Theories**: Some ancient philosophers, such as Empedocles and Anaximander, proposed ideas of transformation and change in the natural world, suggesting that living organisms arose from combinations of fundamental elements or evolved from simpler forms over time.

3.  **Vitalism**: Vitalism, a prominent idea in the medieval and early modern periods, proposed that living organisms possessed a vital force or essence that distinguished them from inanimate matter. While not explicitly evolutionary, vitalistic concepts contributed to debates about the nature of life and its origins.

4.  **Spontaneous Generation**: Spontaneous generation, the belief that living organisms could arise from non-living matter under certain conditions, was a widespread idea in antiquity and the Middle Ages. This notion suggested a form of continuous generation and transformation of life forms but did not imply a process of biological evolution as understood today.

5.  **Transmutation of Species**: Some naturalists in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, proposed theories of transmutation or transformation of species. Lamarck's theory, for example, suggested that organisms could change over time in response to environmental pressures and that acquired traits could be passed on to offspring.

Overall, these pre-Darwinian ideas about evolution reflected early attempts to understand the diversity and complexity of life on Earth. While they did not constitute a comprehensive theory of biological evolution, they contributed to the intellectual foundations upon which Darwin later built his groundbreaking theory of natural selection.

## The Role of Biology (The role of natural evolution as a framework)

The introduction of Biology has these forms, el conjunto de las cuales muestra una línea creciente de aportación a la profundidad del análisis económico y al papel más ligero o pesado en el que interviene en la resolucion de problemas ccomplejos:

-   **Biology as a theoretical framework**, sienta las bases conceptuales y relacionales sobre las que iniciar un análisis complejo en ciencias sociales y en economía. Se trata de un marco teórico que sirve de inspiración para afrontar una primera explicación o una ampliación de la explicación de un problema social complejo sin tener que recurrir a un largo proceso de construcción teórica. Esto no significa que la teoría biológica sea siempre asimilada por la económica, sino que esta última sirve como espejo sobre la que construir un andamiaje teórico de forma más robusta y rápida.

-   **Biology as a metaphora**, esto nos permite mejorar la explicación de los fenómenos económicos y reforzar nuestros argumentos al utilizar cadenas causales que ya están investigadas y demostradas en biología

-   **Biology as a paradigm**, nos permite enfrentar el análisis económico teniendo delante un marco causal ya demostrado que podamos usar como referencia, tanto en el uso de los conceptos como en los flujos de interacción entre ellos. Digamos que el análisis económico no parte de cero ni necesita inventar un adamiaje metodológico y conceptual cada vez, sino que podemos recurrrir a la biología para que nos aporte un marco de reflexión y pensamiento (que podemos ir adaptando a las estructuras y comportamientos que vamos descubriendo en economía) y que nos ahorra mucho tiempo y esfuerzo.

-   **Biology as a canvas** to draw computational methods directamente aplicables a los procesos de resolución de problemas, i.e. captura de datos, modelos lógicos, procesamiento y funcionamiento de la información e interpretación de los resultados. Esto facilita y amplia nuestras capacidades a la hora de recurrir a herramientas que ya están diseñadas y han sido probadas en la resolución de problemas complejos y que podemos manipular y hacer crecer en un entorno computacional.

## The Need for a Meta-Framework in the Social Sciences

*Successfully building well-being in students is not simply a matter of delivering a one-off positive education intervention. Rather, an embedded approach across interconnected systems throughout a whole school is needed (Waters 2011; White and Murray 2015). A meta-framework can give researchers and practitioners a purposeful direction within which to design, apply and evaluate interventions. Such a framework must have broad and generalizable parameters that reflect a comprehensive model of student well-being, while still offering the flexibility needed to choose and/or design interventions that are best suited for different contexts.\@waters2019search* *(...)In addition to its higher-order comprehensive nature, if a meta-framework is going to be useful in advancing positive education it must be evidence-based and actionable. Thankfully, the field has amassed a decent preliminary evidence base on effectiveness to draw upon (see Waters 2017, for a recent review of the field) @waters2019search* *(...)Resultantly, a meta-framework must be useful in supporting the decision making of educators and practitioners applying positive education knowledge and interventions in concrete ways with students. Consistent with leading thinkers in the field who assert that wellbeing is a multidimensional construct, and that students need to have the opportunity to develop a diverse range of skills to build wellbeing (Diener et al. 1999; Forgeard et al. 2011; Keyes and Annas 2009), a meta-framework must be multidimensional.\@waters2019search* *(...)Currently, the majority of frameworks in positive education are not multidimensional but, rather, focus on only one or two aspects of wellbeing. For example,(...) @waters2019search*

**The aim of the qualitative evidence synthesis was to examine people's attitudes towards the taking of agents or supplements that may be used in the primary preven- tion of colorectal cancer, i.e. NSAIDs (including aspirin), vitamins, minerals, folic acid or folate, selenium, calcium and dietary supplements generally. The synthesis included studies that focused on exploring the views, beliefs or attitudes of people who took any of these agents for any purpose. A systematic search to identify relevant studies was performed by an information specialist following piloting of appropriate search strategies. The search combined terms describing the agents of interest (NSAIDs, aspirin, vitamins, etc.) with a pub- lished, validated filter for identifying qualitative studies, together with the medical subject heading "qualitative research" \[11\]. The full search strategy is available in the Appendix [@carroll2011worked]**

**The process involved leveraging an established model to refine a meta-framework for understanding views on the uptake of potential chemopreventive agents. Reviewers critically assessed data categorization, iteratively refining themes based on alignment with data and incorporating new insights. The revised model integrated insights from the original framework and empirical data, resulting in an enhanced conceptual framework to elucidate perspectives on chemopreventive agent uptake.[@carroll2011worked]** \## Research question

One of the key questions that an evolutionary analyst can try to answer is what are the **mechanisms** that explain or direct the escalator of progress, whether this is the "struggle for existence" between individuals, nations, races, etc.

Another question that the evolutionary analyst can try to resolve is whether the individual **permits the struggle** to take place and, if not, to what extent this weakens the individual and, therefore, that the individual enters into a process of degeneration that leads to a replacement by another individual.

*Research questions* *This review seeks to answer two questions:* *What research has been undertaken about the public's views of walking and cycling as modes of transport?* *How do children's, young people's and parents' views of the barriers to, and facilitators of, walking and cycling match interventions evaluated for their effects on walking and cycling?*

(From Methodology)*The review was conducted in three parts. First, we searched for and mapped the existing research literature on the general public's views of walking and cycling. Second, we conducted an in-depth review of a subset of this literature, the scope of which was selected by our Advisory Group, focusing on the views of children, young people and parents. Third, we synthesised the findings relating to these 'views studies' together with the research on interventions carried out by Ogilvie et al. (2004). The overall conclusions of the review are thus based both on international evaluations of specific interventions, and from findings of recent 'qualitative' research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) examining the views and experiences of children, young people and parents.\@brunton2006synthesis*

*1 Scope* *The scope issues in this workshop are very important, but they relate, rather than just to the types of skills considered, to the clarification and positioning of precisely what the proposed ICT Skills Meta-Framework is (and what it is not)@de2006european*

*The design of frameworks arises first and foremost from the intended purpose, or application. This is fundamental, since -- although frameworks designed for one purpose can be, and often are, used for purposes beyond those they were designed for, they may well not be particularly well-suited for the other applications, and so may not perform effectively in that context. In short, frameworks -- once created - can "take on a life of their own", and this can often produce unexpected, and sometimes undesirable, effects in other contexts.\@de2006european*

*In short, the main priority of an ICT Practitioner Skills/Competence Framework (and any European Meta-Framework related to such frameworks) is to provide something largely specified by employers, and of real value to them as well as to those employed as - and those seeking work as - ICT Practitioners, as well as stakeholders associated with both sides of the labour market. Its contribution as a platform via which the proposed EQF can be applied in relation to ICT Practitioner work remains secondary in the context of this Workshop @de2006european*
