# Methodology

## Objetives

The present study delineates a comprehensive meta-framework designed to fulfill several pivotal objectives. Foremost among these aims is the systematic description and synthesis of primary and secondary data, incorporating an examination of the fundamental interrelationships inherent within. Concurrently, the meta-framework endeavors to map the evolutionary trajectory of pertinent studies in the domain of business scholarship and the theory of the firm, aligning them methodically within its overarching structure.

The meta-framework aspires to transcend conventional paradigms of data synthesis, aspiring instead to furnish a novel interpretive lens through which to scrutinize the theory of the firm from an evolutionary standpoint. By foregrounding the dynamic interplay between firms and their milieu, this endeavor represents a departure from static conceptualizations, facilitating a nuanced understanding of organizational behavior within an ever-changing economic landscape.

Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the meta-framework to engender a tangible utility for both academic scholars and industry practitioners alike. Hence, the resultant synthesis is envisaged as a flexible tool, amenable to facilitating a deeper comprehension of firm-level decision-making processes and behavioral dynamics. In effect, the meta-framework is envisaged to serve as a practical aid, fostering enhanced insights and efficacious strategies pertinent to scholarly inquiry and managerial practice within the realm of business economics.

## Rationale for Employing a Meta-Framework

The adoption of a meta-framework as the principal methodological tool is underpinned by several reasons. First is the inherent suitability of framework synthesis for the analysis of descriptive data, particularly when confronted with the imperative to encapsulate the intricate structural nuances and dynamic interaction patterns characterizing the phenomenon or system under scrutiny [@smith2011qualitative]. Given the inherent complexity intrinsic to the evolutionary inquiry into firm behavior, encompassing a multitude of internal and external variables and their interplay, a methodological approach offering a comprehensive depiction of both structural configurations and behavioral dynamics becomes imperative for elucidating this multifaceted domain.

Moreover, the step-by-step procedural framework inherent in synthesis methodology endows it with a commendable level of transparency, thus enabling a clear delineation of the systematic processes guiding data analysis, from descriptive elucidation to explanatory inference. This procedural transparency extends further to encompass the researchers' interpretative endeavors, thereby ensuring a traceable trajectory of analytical insights over the course of the study.

Unlike alternative qualitative data analysis approaches such as grounded theory, narrative methods, or phenomenology, framework analysis adopts a pragmatic epistemological stance, thereby rendering it accommodating to a diverse array of data types and research contexts [@goldsmith2021using; @gale2013using]. This versatility is particularly salient in the context of the present investigation, where primary data derived from conceptual and empirical studies across natural and social sciences, alongside secondary data elucidating evolutionary paradigms within the realm of firm theory, collectively underpin the construction of the meta-framework. By integrating insights from disparate disciplinary domains, the meta-framework aspires to offer a holistic vantage point, transcending disciplinary boundaries to provide a nuanced understanding of evolutionary dynamics within the context of firm behavior.

## What is a Framework?

Although there is no standard, universal definition of what a framework is from a qualitative research standpoint, the literature in general endorses the position of frameworks as bridges between the construction of theories and the way of conducting empirical observations [@partelow2023framework; @mollinga2008rational]. This relevant position of frameworks within the theory of science is in turn reflected in the growth they have experienced in recent decades, to the point of being present in practically all areas of scientific knowledge. Its applications span wide and varied fields within the natural and social sciences, technological development, and environmental and experimental sciences, and many well-established frameworks are regularly applied by scientific organizations and policymakers around the world.

In some cases, frameworks act as valuable tools that help develop a common language and structure research processes [@binder2013comparison]. In other cases they serve as reference material used by scholars and practitioners to navigate the complex interactions between phenomena of different nature and to analyze and integrate the knowledge that thus emerges [@pulver2018frontiers]. Whatever its purpose, if we tried to classify the most used frameworks today, we would realize that there are two main trends: frameworks that aim to capture the complex functioning of a phenomenon or system, and those that seek to simplify the central concepts. This is enough to give us an idea of the importance of frameworks as tools to structure and operationalize scientific knowledge.

From an epistemological point of view, frameworks, whether emerging from the top down or bottom up, cover the imperative need to build a seamless connection between different levels or scales of scientific knowledge, thus linking the higher more general levels of knowledge (a paradigm or a general theory) with the bottom levels (a model or a case study). As such a framework is intended to *"organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory"* [@partelow2023framework]. Ultimately, frameworks aim to make science easier, guiding researchers in their research design and providing them with a groundwork of key concepts and foundational knowledge that they can then measure, compare, and evaluate. This way, researchers do not need to reinvent the wheel with each new investigation and can instead focus their skills on advancing the framework by applying it to other less-known areas, or integrating it with new knowledge from other disciplines.

Frameworks also help researchers position their work within a specific field of practice or knowledge, providing them with a well-grounded set of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms that have been shown to be useful in that field [@cox2016synthesizing]. Therefore, frameworks are not only valuable for synthesizing knowledge and focusing researchers' attention on key concepts and its interrelationships, but they also help drive the community debate, encourage a more collaborative and interdisciplinary research work, and lay the foundation for subsequent empirical efforts and for effective communication of the advances and discoveries being made.

Despite the growth of framework creation in recent years and its widespread applications in science, governance and policy-making, doubts persist about their development and the way in which they can be applied. Very often frameworks are developed from the experience and knowledge of scholars and practitioners themselves. This often earns them the criticism that they act as "black boxes" and do not make clear why some concepts and their relationships are chosen and others are left out. But this is not the only way a framework can be developed. It is also quite common for prior knowledge and experience to be combined with an empirical synthesis process derived from some research, allowing frameworks to emerge in a more robust way.

Once a framework has been created and its applications in a field seem clear, it is time to operationalize it. This will often pose numerous challenges for both its creators and end users. For example, if the purpose of the framework is to guide empirical analysis of a particular phenomenon, scholars and practitioners will need to develop specific strategies for choosing particular cases and conducting synthesis activities. In other cases the need will arise to connect the conceptual framework or the indicators provided by the framework with real-life data. In such cases, issues may arise when interpreting the data and adjusting the framework to reality.

## Steps for Building the Meta-Framework

### Familiarization

The initial phase of meta-framework, familiarization, serves as a pivotal endeavor aimed at providing the researcher with a purposeful understanding of the collected data. Through an immersive engagement with the dataset, researchers embark on a process of discernment, identifying key ideas and recurrent themes that underpin the richness of the data that will serve as the foundation for subsequent analytical endeavors. This phase is instrumental in establishing a foundational comprehension of the dataset, encompassing an exploration of major themes pertinent to the research questions and their recurrence throughout the data. Data familiarization extends until the researcher attains a comprehensive grasp of the dataset's breadth of variation [@ritchie2002qualitative; @goldsmith2021using].

### Identifying a thematic framework

Following the immersion in the data during the familiarization stage, researchers embark on the pivotal task of identifying a thematic framework. This phase marks the transition from data immersion to abstraction and conceptualization, wherein researchers begin to discern underlying patterns and concepts within the data. As researchers review the collected material, they make detailed notes on responses, recurring themes, and significant concepts that emerge organically. The thematic framework serves as a scaffold within which the data can be systematically analyzed and referenced. Drawing upon both a priori issues and emergent themes, researchers strive to construct a framework that encapsulates the richness and complexity of the data while addressing the overarching research objectives.

### Indexing

With the thematic framework in place, researchers proceed to the indexing stage, where they systematically apply the established framework to the textual data. Indexing involves the meticulous process of assigning relevant thematic references to passages within the data, thereby facilitating subsequent analysis and interpretation. As researchers navigate through the textual data, they are tasked with making subjective judgements regarding the meaning and significance of each passage, both in isolation and within the broader context of the research. By annotating the textual data, researchers make the indexing process transparent and accessible, allowing for collaboration and validation within the research community.

### Charting

Having indexed the textual data according to the thematic framework, researchers transition to the charting phase, where they consolidate individual insights into a cohesive portrayal of the data. Charting involves the systematic organization of data based on thematic references, thereby providing researchers with a holistic view of the research findings. By lifting data from its original context and rearranging it according to relevant themes, researchers gain deeper insights into the range of attitudes and experiences encapsulated within the data. This phase lays the groundwork for subsequent analysis and interpretation, enabling researchers to identify patterns and associations that inform the overarching research objectives.

### Mapping and interpretation

As researchers progress through the iterative process of data analysis, they reach the culminating stage of mapping and interpretation. This phase entails synthesizing key characteristics of the data set and elucidating emergent categories, associations, and patterns. Researchers return to the core objectives of qualitative analysis, employing a range of analytical techniques to define concepts, map the range and nature of phenomena, and provide nuanced explanations. By systematically interpreting the data set, researchers contribute to the advancement of knowledge within their respective fields, enriching our understanding of complex social phenomena and informing evidence-based decision-making processes.
