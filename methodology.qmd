# Methodology
The main objectives pursued with this meta-framework are to describe and summarize in a structured way the primary and secondary data analyzed, including the key relationships between them, and to map the evolutionary studies analyzed in the field of business and the theory of the firm onto the meta-framework. Furthermore, the meta-framework seeks to go beyond the synthesis of data and aims to provide a fresh interpretation of the theory of the firm under an evolutionary perspective. It is also expected that the product of the synthesis is directly applicable to the work of scholars and practitioners as a flexible tool that can support their efforts to better understand the decisions and behavior of the firm.

The reason why framework synthesis was chosen is because it is a particularly well-suited approach for the analysis of descriptive data where it is important to capture the complexity in the structure of the phenomenon or system under investigation, as well as the interaction flows that exist between its components [@smith2011qualitative]. In our case, the evolutionary approach to the study of the firm entails a high degree of complexity, in terms of both the number of internal and external variables affected and the nature of their interactions, so a comprehensive structural and behavioral vision is key to understanding.

Furthermore, the synthesis framework is developed following a step-by-step approach, which confers this approach a high level of transparency when describing the processes that guide the systematic analysis of the data, from a descriptive to an explanatory level. This same transparency also applies to researchers' interpretation of data, which can always be traced back over time.

Unlike other approaches to qualitative data analysis (i.e. grounded theory, narrative methods, phenomenology), framework analysis operates under a very pragmatic epistemology, resulting in the application of the methodology to a wide variety of data types and to many different reasons [@goldsmith2021using;@gale2013using]. For the construction of our meta-framework the types of data used are of two types: 1) primary data from conceptual and practical evolutionary studies in the field of natural sciences, social sciences and theory of the firm, 2) secondary data belonging to studies describe, summarize or explain the concept of evolution in the aforementioned fields of knowledge.

## What is a Framework?
Although there is no standard, universal definition of what a framework is from a qualitative research standpoint, the literature in general endorses the position of frameworks as bridges between the construction of theories and the way of conducting empirical observations [@partelow2023framework;@mollinga2008rational]. This relevant position of frameworks within the theory of science is in turn reflected in the growth they have experienced in recent decades, to the point of being present in practically all areas of scientific knowledge. Its applications span wide and varied fields within the natural and social sciences, technological development, and environmental and experimental sciences, and many well-established frameworks are regularly applied by scientific organizations and policymakers around the world.

In some cases, frameworks act as valuable tools that help develop a common language and structure research processes [@binder2013comparison]. In other cases they serve as reference material used by scholars and practitioners to navigate the complex interactions between phenomena of different nature and to analyze and integrate the knowledge that thus emerges [@pulver2018frontiers]. Whatever its purpose, if we tried to classify the most used frameworks today, we would realize that there are two main trends: frameworks that aim to capture the complex functioning of a phenomenon or system, and those that seek to simplify the central concepts. This is enough to give us an idea of the importance of frameworks as tools to structure and operationalize scientific knowledge.

From an epistemological point of view, frameworks, whether emerging from the top down or bottom up, cover the imperative need to build a seamless connection between different levels or scales of scientific knowledge, thus linking the higher more general levels of knowledge (a paradigm or a general theory) with the bottom levels (a model or a case study). As such a framework is intended to *"organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory"* [@partelow2023framework]. Ultimately, frameworks aim to make science easier, guiding researchers in their research design and providing them with a groundwork of key concepts and foundational knowledge that they can then measure, compare, and evaluate. This way, researchers do not need to reinvent the wheel with each new investigation and can instead focus their skills on advancing the framework by applying it to other less-known areas, or integrating it with new knowledge from other disciplines.

Frameworks also help researchers position their work within a specific field of practice or knowledge, providing them with a well-grounded set of interconnected concepts, theories, and paradigms that have been shown to be useful in that field [@cox2016synthesizing].  Therefore, frameworks are not only valuable for synthesizing knowledge and focusing researchers' attention on key concepts and its interrelationships, but they also help drive the community debate, encourage a more collaborative and interdisciplinary research work, and lay the foundation for subsequent empirical efforts and for effective communication of the advances and discoveries being made.  

Despite the growth of framework creation in recent years and its widespread applications in science, governance and policy-making, doubts persist about their development and the way in which they can be applied. Very often frameworks are developed from the experience and knowledge of scholars and practitioners themselves. This often earns them the criticism that they act as "black boxes" and do not make clear why some concepts and their relationships are chosen and others are left out. But this is not the only way a framework can be developed. It is also quite common for prior knowledge and experience to be combined with an empirical synthesis process derived from some research, allowing frameworks to emerge in a more robust way. 

Once a framework has been created and its applications in a field seem clear, it is time to operationalize it. This will often pose numerous challenges for both its creators and end users. For example, if the purpose of the framework is to guide empirical analysis of a particular phenomenon, scholars and practitioners will need to develop specific strategies for choosing particular cases and conducting synthesis activities. In other cases the need will arise to connect the conceptual framework or the indicators provided by the framework with real-life data. In such cases, issues may arise when interpreting the data and adjusting the framework to reality.
