# What is a Framework?

Although there is no standard, universal definition of what a framework is from a qualitative research standpoint, the literature endorses its position as a bridge between theory construction and the way of conducting empirical observations [@partelow2023framework;@mollinga2008rational]. The importance of frameworks is reflected in how in recent decades the number of frameworks that have emerged in virtually all areas of scientific knowledge is overwhelming. Its applications in the field of natural and social sciences, technological development, environmental and experimental sciences are wide and varied, and many well-established frameworks are regularly applied by scientific organizations and policy makers.

In some cases, frameworks act as valuable tools that help develop a common language and structure research processes [@binder2013comparison], while in other cases they serve as reference material used by scholars and practitioners to navigate the complex interactions between phenomena of different nature and to analyze and integrate the knowledge that emerges [@pulver2018frontiers]. If we talk about the types of frameworks most used today, there are frameworks that aim to capture the complex functioning of a phenomenon or system, while others seek to simplify the central concepts. Not surprisingly, anyone attempting to classify even the most common framework types faces a daunting task that is beyond the scope of this article.

From an epistemological point of view, frameworks, whether emerging from the top down or bottom up, cover the imperative need to build a seamless connection between different levels or scales of scientific knowledge, thus linking the higher more general levels of knowledge (a paradigm or general theory) with the bottom levels (a model or case study). As such a framework would *"organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected by a theory"* [@partelow2023framework]. Ultimately, frameworks aim to make science easier, guiding researchers in their research design and providing them with a groundwork of key concepts and foundational knowledge that they can then measure, compare, and evaluate. This way, researchers do not need to reinvent the wheel with each new investigation and can instead focus their skills on advancing the framework by applying it to little-known or unknown areas and integrating it with new knowledge from other disciplines.

Frameworks also help researchers position their work in a specific field of practice or knowledge, providing them with a well-grounded set of interconnected concepts, theories and paradigms that are current in that field [@cox2016synthesizing].  Therefore, frameworks are not only valuable for synthesizing knowledge and focusing researchers' attention on key concepts and its interrelationships, but they also help drive the community debate, encourage a more collaborative and interdisciplinary research work, and lay the foundation for subsequent empirical efforts and for effective communication of the advances and discoveries that are being made.  

Despite the strong growth in the creation of frameworks and their widespread use in applications for science and politics, doubts persist about their development and the way in which they are applied.
