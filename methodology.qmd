# Methodology

*Policy-makers and practitioners are increasingly aware of the limitations of regarding randomised controlled trials as the sole source of ‘evidence’. This has resulted in growing calls for more inclusive forms of review, so that better use may be made of primary data. Some questions can only be appropriately answered by examining a range of data sources; maximum value can be gained from studies able to overcome problems with access to sensitive or hard-to-reach settings; contra- dictions in the evidence-base can be identified and examined; and theory development or specification of operational models can be optimised.@dixon2005synthesising*

*Noblit and Hare introduce a useful distinction between integrative and interpretive reviews. Instead, (Dixon et al., 2005) we suggest that integrative syntheses are those where the focus is on summarising data, and where the concepts (or variables) under which data are to be summarised are assumed to be largely secure and well specified (...) the primary focus of an integrative synthesis is not on the development of concepts or their specification. @dixon2005synthesising*

*we suggest that the defining characteristic of an interpretive synthesis is its concern with the development of concepts, and with the development and specification of theories that integrate those concepts (...) An interpretive synthesis will therefore avoid specifying concepts in advance of the synthesis. In contrast with an integrative synthesis, it will not be concerned to fix the meaning of those concepts at an early stage. @dixon2005synthesising*

*The interpretive analysis that yields the synthesis is conceptual in process and output, and the main product is not aggregations of data, but theory. Again it is important not to caricature an interpretive (...) Again it is important not to caricature an interpretive synthesis as therefore floating free of any empirical anchor: an interpretive synthesis of primary studies must be grounded in the data reported in those studies (...) might be concerned with the generation of middle-range theories – explanations which apply in a specified domain, such as seeking to explain why people defer help-seeking for some types of symptoms. We argue that interpretive syntheses can be carried out on all types of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative.  @dixon2005synthesising*

*There is considerable overlap. Whilst most forms of synthesis can be characterised as being either primarily interpretive or primarily integrative in form and process, every integrative synthesis will include elements of interpretation, and every interpretive synthesis will include elements of aggregation of data. The choice of the form of synthesis is likely to be crucially related to the form and nature of the research question being asked @dixon2005synthesising*

*Thematic analysis*
*Thematic analysis, clearly sharing some overlaps with narrative summary and content analysis, involves the identification of prominent or recurrent themes in the literature, and summarising the findings of different studies under thematic headings. Summary tables, providing descriptions of the key points, can then be produced.@dixon2005synthesising*

*Thematic analysis allows clear identification of prominent themes, and organised and structured ways of dealing with the literature under these themes. It is flexible, allowing considerable latitude to reviewers and a means of integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence. However, it suffers from several important problems. Thematic analysis can be either data driven – driven by the themes identified in the literature itself – or theory driven – oriented to evaluation of particular themes through interrogation of the literature. The failure of much writing on thematic analysis to distinguish adequately between these two approaches has resulted in a lack of transparency. @dixon2005synthesising*

*It is unclear whether the structure of the analysis should reflect the frequency with which particular themes are reported, or whether the analysis should be weighted towards themes that appear to have a high level of explanatory value. If thematic analysis is limited to summarising themes reported in primary studies, it offers little by way of theoretical structure within which to develop higher order thematic categories beyond those identified from the literature @dixon2005synthesising*

*Framework analysis was originally developed as a method for analysing primary data in applied social research. We describe here how the same principles were employed in a systematic review to label the data of research reports in meaningful and manageable sections for subsequent retrieval and exploration. The result is both a general method for systematically reviewing diverse literature, and a framework for analysing public involvement in research in particular. @oliver2008multidimensional*

*The conceptual framework described in this paper built on our own experiences of public involvement, and on a detailed and sensitive search strategy to identify, then appraise and analyse relevant literature. @oliver2008multidimensional*


Meta-framework analysis is a qualitative research method used to analyze and synthesize findings from multiple qualitative studies, particularly when those studies employ different theoretical frameworks or methodologies. This approach goes beyond traditional qualitative synthesis methods by aiming to integrate diverse perspectives and theories into a cohesive framework that captures the complexity of the research topic. Framework synthesis offers a highly structured approach to organizing and analyzing a sheer amount of data that presents the challenge for rigorous analysis (@barnett2009methods).

*Ritchie et al.(2003) in their advocacy of framework analysis. In framework analysis, before applying codes to the text, the researcher is encouraged to build up a list of key thematic ideas. These can be taken from the literature and previous research but are also generated by reading through at least some of the transcripts and other documents such as field notes, focus groups and printed documents.A similar view is taken by King (1998), who recommends the construction of a template, using similar sources of inspiration, which is a hierarchical arrangement of potential codes. In both King’s template analysis and framework analysis, coding consists of the identification of chunks of text that exemplify the codes in this initial list. However, all these authors recognize that the researcher will need to amend the list of codes during analysis as new ideas and new ways of categorizing are detected in the text. @gibbs2018analyzing*

*They employed an iterative process involving familiarization with the literature, gradually developing a conceptual framework based on concepts derived from the review question and the theoretical and empirical literature, applying the framework systematically to evidence from the studies included in the review, and constructing a chart for each key dimension with distilled summaries from all relevant documents @dixon2011using.*

*Framework synthesis is distinct from the other methods outlined here in that it utilises an a priori „framework‟ -- informed by background material and team discussions -- to extract and synthesize findings. As such, it is largely a deductive approach although, in addition to topics identified by the framework, new topics may be developed and incorporated as they emerge from the data. (...) One of the novel features of their approach is their use of a conceptual model that was used as an initial starting point for coding the evidence from 20 studies. This conceptual model was chosen because of its broad applicability to the area under review, and the authors did not engage in the more lengthy process of model specification that is often more characteristic of framework synthesis. They augmented analysis using this prespecified model with analysis that was more inductive, and ended up generating a revised conceptual model that provided a 'best fit' to the evidence reported in the studies they reviewed. The revised model included some factors that were absent from the original model, as well as adjustments to factors that had been reported in that model.(@barnett2009methods)*

*The synthetic product can be expressed in the form of a chart for each key dimension identified, which may be used to map the nature and range of the concept under study and find associations between themes and exceptions to these (Brunton et al 2006). (@barnett2009methods).*

*Brunton et al applied the approach to a review of children‟s, young people‟s and parents‟ views of walking and cycling; Oliver et al to analyse public involvement in health services research. Framework synthesis is distinct from the other methods outlined here in that it utilises an a priori „framework‟ -- informed by background material and team discussions -- to extract and synthesise findings. As such, it is largely a deductive approach although, in addition to topics identified by the framework, new topics may be developed and incorporated as they emerge from the data. The synthetic product can be expressed in the form of a chart for each key dimension identified, which may be used to map the nature and range of the concept under study and find associations between themes and exceptions to these (Brunton et al 2006).*

*framework synthesis builds on framework analysis,*

## Characteristics

In **epistemological terms**, if we consider at two ends of the spectrum, one a highly constructivist vision of knowledge, and at the other, an unproblematized vision of knowledge as an "objective window open to the world," the framework synthesis, although still implies a certain interpretation of the data, shares the attributes of critical realism where knowledge of reality is mediated by our perceptions and beliefs. Furthermore, its synthesis results are reproducible and correspond to a shareable objective reality.

Regarding the extent of iteration during the review process, framework analysis involves an iterative process of searching the literature.

Assessing quality is a key component in the review process of framework analysis. Typically, when performing a framework analysis, quality criteria are set for the selection of literature. Those studies that do not meet a certain number of the criteria are excluded.

Framework analysis focuses on describing and summarising their primary data (often in a highly structured and detailed way) and translating the studies into one another. However, it also seeks to push beyond the original data to a fresh interpretation of the phenomena under review.

With regards of the synthetic product, namely, what is the synthesis for? It is clear that framework analysis views itself as producing an output that is directly applicable to policy makers and designers of interventions. There are a few framework synthesis which involved policy makers and practitioners in directing the focus of the synthesis and used the themes derived from the synthesis to infer what kind of interventions might be most effective in encouraging walking and cycling. Likewise, the products of the thematic synthesis took the form of practical recommendations for interventions (e.g. „do not promote fruit and vegetables in the same way in the same intervention‟).

## Key steps of meta-framework

Here are the key steps involved in conducting a meta-framework analysis:

1.  **Identify relevant studies**: Conduct a systematic search to identify qualitative studies related to the research topic. These studies may employ different theoretical frameworks, methodologies, or perspectives.

2.  **Extract data**: Extract relevant data from each included study, including key concepts, themes, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies used.

3.  **Code and categorize**: Analyze the extracted data by coding and categorizing the concepts, themes, and frameworks identified in the included studies. This process involves identifying similarities and differences across the studies.

4.  **Develop a meta-framework**: Based on the coded data, develop a meta-framework that integrates the key concepts, themes, and theoretical frameworks identified in the included studies. The meta-framework should capture the overarching structure or framework that emerges from the synthesis of the individual studies.

5.  **Refine the meta-framework**: Iteratively refine the meta-framework by revisiting the coded data and ensuring that it accurately represents the diversity of perspectives and theories present in the included studies.

6.  **Analyze relationships**: Analyze the relationships between different elements of the meta-framework, such as how concepts and themes from different theoretical frameworks relate to each other or intersect.

7.  **Interpret findings**: Interpret the findings of the meta-framework analysis in relation to the research question or objective. Discuss the implications of the synthesized framework for theory, practice, and future research.

8.  **Report results**: Write up the results of the meta-framework analysis, describing the methodology used, presenting the synthesized framework, and providing supporting evidence from the included studies.

Meta-framework analysis offers a systematic approach to synthesizing qualitative research findings from diverse theoretical perspectives and methodologies. By integrating these perspectives into a cohesive framework, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field.

*The framework approach has five stages (which share features of both the comparative and translational approaches to interpretive synthesis described above):*
*1 familiarisation with the data and/or studies (i.e. reading and re-reading)*
*2 identification of a thematic framework, typically derived form the research questions*
*3 indexing or coding of the data/ and/or studies*
*4 charting (i.e. transfer of summaries to matrix displays)*
*5 mapping and interpretation*

### Literature selection
Criterios para elegir la literatura primaria y complementaria. Criterios de búsqueda en base de datos.

*To uncover peer reviewed research on school-based positive education interventions, a systematic literature search was conducted using the four databases of: Scopus®, Google Scholar, PsycINFO®, and Web of Science®. Additionally, the reference lists of review articles that were identified through the above search were cross-checked using the ancestry method outlined in Lyubomirsky et al. (2005), in order to capture the broadest collection of relevant articles possible. To qualify for inclusion, studies had to meet eight key criteria. First, the study had to be peer-reviewed and published in an academic journal and, thus, have withstood the scrutiny of the peer review process. Second, the (...) @waters2019search*

*Seventy-five school-based positive education intervention studies were identified as meeting the criteria above and form the basis of this review. Table One provides definitions of the six SEARCH pathways and lists the sub-categories of interventions that were identified in each pathway for the current review. @waters2019search*

*For consistency across the presentation of the review findings, the same structure has been used when mapping each of the six pathways to the studies identified. First, the specific interventions that can be mapped to each pathway are identified. For example, under the pathway of attention and awareness, the specific interventions identified in the school-based interventions were mindfulness and meditation (...)@waters2019search*

*Finally, and most importantly, the evidence supporting each pathway is considered. This evaluation is structured around the three key research questions listed in the former section and considers how the evidence meets Seligman et al.’s(2009) broad aims of positive education: to improve both wellbeing and academic outcomes.@waters2019search*
*3.2 Pathway One: Strengths*

*Literature searching and analysis*
*Our literature searches across medicine, nursing, social welfare and the social sciences covered reports published in academic journals and patient- and carer-group publications, and unpublished reports accessible through professional and patient or public networks. As we accumulated literature, we followed an iterative process similar to framework analysis as applied to primary research data (ver Ritchie). This involved familiarization with the literature; gradually developing a conceptual framework using concepts embedded in the review question, and in the theoretical and empirical literature; applying the framework systematically to the data; and subsequently rearranging the data within the framework in order to construct a chart for each key dimension with distilled summaries from all relevant documents identified. The charts were then used to map the range and nature of involvement and find associations between themes with a view to providing explanations for the findings. We describe below the key concepts used to build our framework, and how these were combined so as to enable us to analyse and draw conclusions from the literature. @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Categorizing the literature*
*As well as reports of public involvement, we found discussion papers about differing priorities, conceptual frameworks, community equi- poise, power, democratic practice and advocacy. These papers drew on a wide range of theories, and described episodes of involvement in many different research areas. (...)The health topics covered in the literature included different health conditions (asthma, breastfeeding (...) The papers came from different disciplines (agricul- ture, genetics, environmental studies) and reported different research methodologies (sys- tematic reviews, technology assessment, participatory research).  @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Reports of public involvement were first characterized as ÔpurposefulÕ, ÔopportunisticÕ or ÔindirectÕ. (a continuación hay que explicar a qué se refiere cada) @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Framework analysis is designed so that it can be viewed and assessed by people other than the primary analyst. Consequently, framework analysis in a systematic review displays the data in such a way that readers can navigate the charts to find evidence relevant to their circumstances (in this case, for instance, international or national programmes or individual projects), or to the options available to them (e.g. patient organizations responding to consultations or only entering collaborative partnerships or taking the initiative). Applying the framework to these data reveals the theories that have been applied to work constructively with individuals,23,24 or within organizations (...) Thus, readers can draw out for themselves relevant implications for their policy and practice from what is known about public involvement in research agenda setting @oliver2008multidimensional*

**The review was conducted in three parts. First, we searched for and mapped the existing research literature on the general public's views of walking and cycling. Second, we conducted an in-depth review of a subset of this literature, the scope of which was selected by our Advisory Group, focusing on the views of children, young people and parents. Third, we synthesised the findings relating to these ‘views studies’ together with the research on interventions carried out by Ogilvie et al. (2004). The overall conclusions of the review are thus based both on international evaluations of specific interventions, and from findings of recent ‘qualitative’ research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) examining the views and experiences of children, young people and parents. @brunton2006synthesis*

*Analysis of this research revealed four recurrent themes drawn from the views of children, young people and parents: a culture of car use; fear and dislike of local environments; children as responsible transport users; and parental responsibility and behaviour.@brunton2006synthesis*

## Other Alterantive Methods
*Meta-synthesis*

*Thematic analysis (TA) is a technique for the analysis of qualitative data which allows you to identify or develop patterns of meaning and/or central ideas that unify them (referred to as themes) pertaining to a given set of data. You will then use these themes to organize, describe or interpret (perceptions of) reality (Boyatzis, 1998; Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2021). Once (relationships among) themes are identified, you need to interpret their relevance and implications for the research question you aim to answer. Verbal individual or group interviews (see King et al. 2018), focus group data (see Barbour, 2008) or textual data (written material) are usually at the core of thematic research. Nevertheless, video material and images might also be thematically analysed (Joffe, 2012).@stevens2022qualitative*


### Atlas.ti

**Process (according to Atlas.ti):** Thematic framework: Central to framework analysis is the development of a framework identifying key themes, concepts, and relationships in the data. The framework guides the subsequent stages of coding and charting.

Flexibility: While it provides a clear structure, framework analysis is also adaptable. Depending on the objectives of the study, researchers can modify the process to better suit their data and questions.

Iterative process: The process in framework analysis is not linear. As data is collected and data analysis progresses, researchers often revisit earlier stages, refining the framework or revising codes to better capture the nuances in the data.\*

**Benefits of framework analysis** Conducting framework analysis has several advantages:

Rigorous data management: The structured approach means data is managed and analyzed with a high level of rigor, minimizing the potential influence of preconceptions.

Inclusivity: Framework analysis accommodates both a priori issues, driven by the research questions, and emergent issues that arise from the data itself.

Comparability: Given its structured nature, framework analysis allows researchers to compare and contrast data, facilitating the identification of patterns and differences.

Accessibility: By presenting data in a summarized, charted form, findings from framework analysis become more accessible and comprehensible, aiding in reporting and disseminating results.

Relevance for applied research: Given its origins in policy research and its clear focus on addressing specific research questions, framework analysis is particularly relevant for studies aiming to inform policy or practice.

**Implementing** Familiarization with the data Before discussing a more detailed analysis, it's paramount to understand the breadth and depth of the data at hand.

Reading and re-reading: Begin by reading textual data such as transcripts, field notes, and other data sources multiple times. This immersion allows researchers to understand participants' perspectives and grasp the overall context.

Noting preliminary ideas: As researchers familiarize themselves with the data, preliminary themes or ideas may start to emerge. Jotting these down in memos helps in forming an initial understanding and can be instrumental in the subsequent phase of developing a set of themes.

Developing a thematic framework As is the case across nearly all types of qualitative methodology, central to framework analysis is the construction of a robust analytical framework. This structure aids in organizing and interpreting the data.

Identifying key themes: Based on the initial familiarization, it's important to identify themes that occur in the multimedia or textual data. These themes should be relevant to the research question. Researchers can begin assigning codes to specific chunks of data to capture emerging themes.

Categorizing and coding: Each identified theme can further be broken down into sub-themes or brought together under categories. At this stage, researchers can continue coding (or recoding) their data according to these themes or categories.

Refining the framework: As the analysis progresses, the initial themes represented by your coding framework may need adjustments. It's an iterative process, where the framework can be continually refined to better fit the data.

Indexing and charting the data Once the framework is established, the next phase involves systematically applying it to the data.

Indexing: Using the resulting coding framework, you can verify that codes have been systematically assigned to relevant portions of the data. This ensures every relevant piece of data is categorized under the appropriate theme or sub-theme.

Charting: This step involves creating charts or matrices for each theme. Data from different sources (like interviews or focus groups) is summarized under the relevant theme. For example, a table can be created with each theme in a column and each data source in a row, and researchers can then populate the cells with relevant data extracts or notes. These charts provide a visual representation, allowing researchers to easily see patterns or discrepancies in the data.

Mapping and Interpretation: With the data systematically charted, researchers can begin to map the relationships between themes and interpret the broader implications. This step is where the true essence of the research emerges, as researchers link the patterns in the data to the broader objectives of the study.

Framework analysis is an involved process, with intentional decision-making at every step of the way. As a result, implementing structured qualitative methodologies such as framework analysis requires patience, meticulous attention to detail, and a clear understanding of the research objectives. When conducted diligently, it offers a transparent and systematic approach to analyzing qualitative data, ensuring the research not only has depth but also clarity.

Whether comparing data across multiple sources or drilling down into the nuances of individual narratives, framework analysis equips researchers with the tools needed to derive meaningful insights from their qualitative data. As more researchers across disciplines recognize its value, it stands to become an even more integral part of the research landscape.

## Benefits

Putting more time into specifying the model, using a wider range of literature, and gaining the views of a wider range of stakeholders may all be important in improving the legitimacy and validity of any ensuring synthesis @dixon2011using.

**Purpose of Meta-Framework**

- A meta-framework is understood as an overarching frame for what should inform the analysis and eventually the design of STI practice frameworks, meaning frameworks used by or provided for transportation policy and planning bodies to select and apply indicators for sustainable transportation. The meta-framework is not a general theory, nor a master framework to be adopted directly by agencies, but a **classification** and **evaluation** device. @cornet2015building

- Comparative analysis based on the meta-framework could identify common features and gaps, and be used as **a basis for testing hypotheses** regarding how indicators influence decisions on option generation, design, operation, maintenance and other aspects of transportation systems. Eventually it should help evolve sustainability measurement in transportation planning from a position as a niche, ad hoc, or add-on activity into something like an “Organizing Principle for Transportation Agencies”, as it has recently been formulated (21). @cornet2015building

- Therefore, rather than a ‘recipe’ to be applied directly by agencies, the meta-framework is first and foremost a scheme for further empirical analysis of existing frameworks. The next step is to refine and apply the criteria via empirical analysis of how frameworks have been developed and used in real world conditions. Eventually this will allow for building a robust set of criteria based on theory as well as realism @cornet2015building

## The pearl-growing technique

It is a method used in qualitative research to identify additional sources of information or relevant studies based on the references, citations, or recommendations found in already identified sources. The name "pearl-growing" metaphorically refers to the process of gradually accumulating valuable "pearls" of information as researchers expand their search based on leads found in the initial set of sources.

Here's how the pearl-growing technique typically works:

Initial search: Researchers begin by conducting an initial literature search using databases, search engines, or other sources to identify relevant sources related to their research topic.

Review of references: Once relevant sources are identified, researchers carefully review the reference lists or bibliographies of these sources. They pay particular attention to the sources cited within the papers, as well as any recommended readings provided by the authors.

Identification of additional sources: Researchers then use the references found in the initial set of sources to identify additional studies, articles, books, or other materials that may contain relevant information or contribute to their understanding of the topic.

Iterative process: The process of reviewing references and identifying additional sources is iterative, meaning that researchers continue to expand their search based on the leads found in each round of searching. This process may involve reviewing the references of newly identified sources and repeating the search until saturation is reached, meaning that no new relevant sources are being found.

Evaluation of relevance: As new sources are identified, researchers evaluate their relevance to the research question or objectives. They consider factors such as the alignment of the content with the research topic, the quality of the source, and its potential contribution to the overall understanding of the topic.

Incorporation into the analysis: Finally, researchers incorporate the findings from the additional sources into their analysis or synthesis of the literature. They integrate these new insights with those obtained from the initial set of sources to develop a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

The pearl-growing technique is valuable for ensuring that researchers identify a diverse range of perspectives, theories, and findings relevant to their research topic. By systematically expanding their search based on the references found in already identified sources, researchers can enhance the depth and breadth of their literature review and increase the likelihood of identifying important insights and contributions to the field.

*The methodology uses the bases of a meta-theory and meta-history, parting from a seminal work in that of Marshall. From there the author draws and follows a timeline with which a progress in the motivations and contributions made by biology in economics and business studies can be traced. - How a seminal work is defined? - How the author decides to entertain around a certain seminal work and the works around it?*

*The meta-analysis is nit exhaustive not complete, The conclusions are extracted once saturation is achieved @barnett2009methods.*

*Paterson et al described meta-synthesis as a process which creates a new interpretation which accounts for the results of all three elements of analysis; however, they do not make it clear exactly how all three components of analysis are brought together to achieve this „new interpretation‟.*

## Differences with systematic review

Meta-synthesis and systematic literature review are both methods used in qualitative research to synthesize findings from multiple studies, but they differ in their objectives, approaches, and synthesis techniques. Here are the key differences between meta-synthesis and systematic literature review:

1.  **Objective**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: The primary objective of meta-synthesis is to integrate and interpret qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new understandings, theories, or conceptual frameworks. Meta-synthesis aims to generate insights that go beyond the individual studies and provide a deeper understanding of the research topic.
    -   Systematic literature review: The primary objective of a systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a particular topic. It aims to summarize and critically evaluate the findings of relevant studies, identify gaps or inconsistencies in the literature, and provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge.
2.  **Approach**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: Meta-synthesis typically involves a qualitative analysis approach, where researchers extract, analyze, and interpret qualitative data from multiple studies. It often involves thematic analysis, constant comparison, or other qualitative synthesis techniques to identify common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies.
    -   Systematic literature review: Systematic literature reviews can involve both qualitative and quantitative research methods, depending on the nature of the research question and available literature. They follow a systematic and transparent process for searching, selecting, appraising, and synthesizing studies, often using predetermined criteria and structured data extraction forms.
3.  **Synthesis technique**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: In meta-synthesis, researchers synthesize qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new interpretations, theories, or frameworks. This synthesis may involve identifying common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies, as well as exploring relationships, contradictions, or divergent perspectives within the data.
    -   Systematic literature review: In a systematic literature review, the synthesis may involve summarizing and categorizing the findings of included studies, identifying trends or patterns in the data, and providing a narrative or descriptive synthesis of the literature. The focus is on summarizing and synthesizing existing knowledge rather than generating new interpretations or theories.
4.  **Output**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: The output of a meta-synthesis is often a synthesized framework, model, or theory that integrates findings from multiple qualitative studies. This output provides a deeper understanding of the research topic and may generate new insights or perspectives.
    -   Systematic literature review: The output of a systematic literature review is typically a comprehensive summary of the existing literature, including key findings, trends, gaps, and recommendations for future research. It provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge on the topic and may inform practice, policy, or further research.

In summary, while both meta-synthesis and systematic literature review involve synthesizing findings from multiple studies, they differ in their objectives, approaches, synthesis techniques, and output. Meta-synthesis aims to develop new interpretations or frameworks based on qualitative data, while systematic literature reviews provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a topic.

## 3.2 Structured Review of Key Existing Frameworks
*As can be seen from the above, assessing skills/competence frameworks is not a simple task.*

*In this situation the Workshop has examined tools that can help in the structured review of what is currently available. These tools are essentially of two kinds:*

*• “top-down” approaches, where the main characteristics of the different frameworks are presented in what might be viewed as a structured inventory – drawing on Dutch experience with the Generic Referential ICT Profiles (GRIP) approach (Hacquebard, 2005) , and*

*• “bottom-up” approaches, where each profile specification is analysed in terms of the underlying units of competence, skills and knowledge (the e-Competences and Certifications Observatory (eCCO) project, researching the use of “Knowledge Objects” as the “underlying unit”, leads developments here). A summary of the principles of the eCCO approach is presented in Annex G.*

*This CWA uses the Top-down approach, but supports the development of complementary Bottom-up approaches as potentially providing more rigorous analysis for comparison and design. In particular completion of the eCCO approach in this regard is awaited with interest  @de2006european*
