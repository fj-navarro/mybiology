# Methodology
The methodology uses the bases of a meta-theory and meta-history, parting from a seminal work in that of Marshall. From there the author draws and follows a timeline with which a progress in the motivations and contributions made by biology in economics and business studies can be traced.
-     How a seminal work is defined?
-     How the author decides to entretain around a certain seminal work and the works around it?

The meta-analysis is nit exhaustive not complete, 
The conclusions are extracted once saturation is achieved.
