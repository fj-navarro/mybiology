# Methodology

## Introduction

*framework analysis was developed for the explicit purpose of analyzing qualitative data in applied policy research. Framework analysis is an inherently comparative form of thematic analysis which employs an organized structure of inductively- and deductively-derived themes (i.e., a framework) to conduct cross-sectional analysis using a combination of data description and abstraction.\@goldsmith2021using*

*The Framework Method was developed by researchers, Jane Ritchie and Liz Spencer, from the Qualitative Research Unit at the National Centre for Social Research in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s for use in large-scale policy research \[1\]. It is now used widely in other areas, including health research \[3-12\].Its defining feature is the matrix output: rows (cases), columns (codes) and 'cells' of summarised data, providing a structure into which the researcher can systematically reduce the data, in order to analyse it by case and by code \[1\].(...) Comparing and contrasting data is vital to qualitative analysis and the ability to compare with ease data across cases as well as within individual cases is built into the structure and process of the Framework Method. @gale2013using. también @smith2011qualitative*

*The Framework Method provides clear steps to follow and produces highly structured outputs of summarised data. It is therefore useful where multiple researchers are working on a project, particularly in multi-disciplinary research teams were not all members have experience of qualitative data analysis, and for managing large data sets where obtaining a holistic, descriptive overview of the entire data set is desirable. (...) Importantly, the Framework Method cannot accommodate highly heterogeneous data, i.e. data must cover similar topics or key issues so that it is possible to categorize it @gale2013using*

*The Framework Method is most commonly used for the thematic analysis of semi-structured interview transcripts, which is what we focus on in this article, although it could, in principle, be adapted for other types of textual data \[13\], including documents, such as meeting minutes or diaries \[12\], or field notes from observations \[10\].(...) Moreover, reflexiv- ity, rigour and quality are issues that are requisite in the Framework Method just as they are in other qualitative methods @gale2013using*

*The Framework Method for the management and analysis of qualitative data has been used since the 1980s \[1\]. The method originated in large-scale social policy research but is becoming an increasingly popular approach in medical and health research; however, there is some confusion about its potential application and limitations.\@gale2013using*

*The overall objective of framework analysis is to identify, describe, and interpret key patterns within and across cases of and themes within the phenomenon of interest. This flexible and powerful method of analysis has been applied to a variety of data types and used in a range of ways in applied research. Framework analysis consists of two major components: creating an analytic framework and applying this analytic framework. This paper details the five steps in framework analysis (data familiarization, framework identification, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation) through conducting secondary analysis on this special issue's common dataset. @goldsmith2021using*

*Framework analysis---also known as "the framework approach," "the framework technique" and "the framework method"---is an inherently comparative form of thematic analysis which employs an organized structure of inductively- and deductively- derived themes (i.e., a framework) to conduct cross-sectional analysis using a combination of data description and abstraction (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Spencer, Ritchie, Ormston, et al., 2014). The overall objective of framework analysis is to identify, describe, and interpret key patterns within and across cases of and themes within the phenomenon of interest through being both grounded in and interpreting from the data (Gale et al., 2013; King & Brooks, 2018; Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Spencer, Ritchie, Ormston, et al., 2014).\@goldsmith2021using*

*Policy-makers and practitioners are increasingly aware of the limitations of regarding randomised controlled trials as the sole source of 'evidence'. This has resulted in growing calls for more inclusive forms of review, so that better use may be made of primary data. Some questions can only be appropriately answered by examining a range of data sources; maximum value can be gained from studies able to overcome problems with access to sensitive or hard-to-reach settings; contra- dictions in the evidence-base can be identified and examined; and theory development or specification of operational models can be optimised.\@dixon2005synthesising*

*Noblit and Hare introduce a useful distinction between integrative and interpretive reviews. Instead, (Dixon et al., 2005) we suggest that integrative syntheses are those where the focus is on summarising data, and where the concepts (or variables) under which data are to be summarised are assumed to be largely secure and well specified (...) the primary focus of an integrative synthesis is not on the development of concepts or their specification. @dixon2005synthesising*

*we suggest that the defining characteristic of an interpretive synthesis is its concern with the development of concepts, and with the development and specification of theories that integrate those concepts (...) An interpretive synthesis will therefore avoid specifying concepts in advance of the synthesis. In contrast with an integrative synthesis, it will not be concerned to fix the meaning of those concepts at an early stage. @dixon2005synthesising*

*The interpretive analysis that yields the synthesis is conceptual in process and output, and the main product is not aggregations of data, but theory. Again it is important not to caricature an interpretive (...) Again it is important not to caricature an interpretive synthesis as therefore floating free of any empirical anchor: an interpretive synthesis of primary studies must be grounded in the data reported in those studies (...) might be concerned with the generation of middle-range theories -- explanations which apply in a specified domain, such as seeking to explain why people defer help-seeking for some types of symptoms. We argue that interpretive syntheses can be carried out on all types of evidence, both qualitative and quantitative. @dixon2005synthesising*

*There is considerable overlap. Whilst most forms of synthesis can be characterised as being either primarily interpretive or primarily integrative in form and process, every integrative synthesis will include elements of interpretation, and every interpretive synthesis will include elements of aggregation of data. The choice of the form of synthesis is likely to be crucially related to the form and nature of the research question being asked @dixon2005synthesising*

*Thematic analysis* *Thematic analysis, clearly sharing some overlaps with narrative summary and content analysis, involves the identification of prominent or recurrent themes in the literature, and summarising the findings of different studies under thematic headings. Summary tables, providing descriptions of the key points, can then be produced.\@dixon2005synthesising*

*Thematic analysis allows clear identification of prominent themes, and organised and structured ways of dealing with the literature under these themes. It is flexible, allowing considerable latitude to reviewers and a means of integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence. However, it suffers from several important problems. Thematic analysis can be either data driven -- driven by the themes identified in the literature itself -- or theory driven -- oriented to evaluation of particular themes through interrogation of the literature. The failure of much writing on thematic analysis to distinguish adequately between these two approaches has resulted in a lack of transparency. @dixon2005synthesising*

*It is unclear whether the structure of the analysis should reflect the frequency with which particular themes are reported, or whether the analysis should be weighted towards themes that appear to have a high level of explanatory value. If thematic analysis is limited to summarising themes reported in primary studies, it offers little by way of theoretical structure within which to develop higher order thematic categories beyond those identified from the literature @dixon2005synthesising*

*Framework analysis was originally developed as a method for analysing primary data in applied social research. We describe here how the same principles were employed in a systematic review to label the data of research reports in meaningful and manageable sections for subsequent retrieval and exploration. The result is both a general method for systematically reviewing diverse literature, and a framework for analysing public involvement in research in particular. @oliver2008multidimensional*

*The conceptual framework described in this paper built on our own experiences of public involvement, and on a detailed and sensitive search strategy to identify, then appraise and analyse relevant literature. @oliver2008multidimensional*

Meta-framework analysis is a qualitative research method used to analyze and synthesize findings from multiple qualitative studies, particularly when those studies employ different theoretical frameworks or methodologies. This approach goes beyond traditional qualitative synthesis methods by aiming to integrate diverse perspectives and theories into a cohesive framework that captures the complexity of the research topic. Framework synthesis offers a highly structured approach to organizing and analyzing a sheer amount of data that presents the challenge for rigorous analysis (@barnett2009methods).

*Ritchie et al.(2003) in their advocacy of framework analysis. In framework analysis, before applying codes to the text, the researcher is encouraged to build up a list of key thematic ideas. These can be taken from the literature and previous research but are also generated by reading through at least some of the transcripts and other documents such as field notes, focus groups and printed documents.A similar view is taken by King (1998), who recommends the construction of a template, using similar sources of inspiration, which is a hierarchical arrangement of potential codes. In both King's template analysis and framework analysis, coding consists of the identification of chunks of text that exemplify the codes in this initial list. However, all these authors recognize that the researcher will need to amend the list of codes during analysis as new ideas and new ways of categorizing are detected in the text. @gibbs2018analyzing*

*They employed an iterative process involving familiarization with the literature, gradually developing a conceptual framework based on concepts derived from the review question and the theoretical and empirical literature, applying the framework systematically to evidence from the studies included in the review, and constructing a chart for each key dimension with distilled summaries from all relevant documents @dixon2011using.*

*Framework synthesis is distinct from the other methods outlined here in that it utilises an a priori „framework‟ -- informed by background material and team discussions -- to extract and synthesize findings. As such, it is largely a deductive approach although, in addition to topics identified by the framework, new topics may be developed and incorporated as they emerge from the data. (...) One of the novel features of their approach is their use of a conceptual model that was used as an initial starting point for coding the evidence from 20 studies. This conceptual model was chosen because of its broad applicability to the area under review, and the authors did not engage in the more lengthy process of model specification that is often more characteristic of framework synthesis. They augmented analysis using this prespecified model with analysis that was more inductive, and ended up generating a revised conceptual model that provided a 'best fit' to the evidence reported in the studies they reviewed. The revised model included some factors that were absent from the original model, as well as adjustments to factors that had been reported in that model.(@barnett2009methods)*

*The synthetic product can be expressed in the form of a chart for each key dimension identified, which may be used to map the nature and range of the concept under study and find associations between themes and exceptions to these (Brunton et al 2006). (@barnett2009methods).*

*Brunton et al applied the approach to a review of children‟s, young people‟s and parents‟ views of walking and cycling; Oliver et al to analyse public involvement in health services research. Framework synthesis is distinct from the other methods outlined here in that it utilises an a priori „framework‟ -- informed by background material and team discussions -- to extract and synthesise findings. As such, it is largely a deductive approach although, in addition to topics identified by the framework, new topics may be developed and incorporated as they emerge from the data. The synthetic product can be expressed in the form of a chart for each key dimension identified, which may be used to map the nature and range of the concept under study and find associations between themes and exceptions to these (Brunton et al 2006).*

*framework synthesis builds on framework analysis,*

*This type of synthesis is based on framework analysis \[3\] and "offers a highly structured approach to organising and analysing data (e.g. indexing using numerical codes, rearranging data into charts etc.)" \[2\]. It involves the preliminary identifi- cation of apriori themes against which to map data from included studies. In contrast to such methods as meta-ethnography \[4\], framework synthesis is primarily a deductive approach. (...) a framework may not simply be an instrument for analysis but may also represent a scaffold against which findings from the different components of an assessment may be brought together and organised @carroll2011worked*

## What is a framework

*There is no universal definition of a framework, but it is useful to provide a brief overview of different definitions for orientation. The Cambridge Dictionary states that frameworks are "a supporting structure around which something can be built; a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide something."(...) Binder et al., (2013, 1) state that frameworks are useful for developing "a common language, to structure research on SES, and to provide guidance toward a more sustainable development of SES."(...) Pulver et al., (2018, 1) suggest that frameworks "assist scholars and practitioners to analyze the complex, nonlinear interdependencies that characterize interactions between biophysical and social arenas and to navigate the new epistemological, ontological, analytical, and practical horizons of integrating knowledge for sustainability solutions." @partelow2023framework*

*It is important to recognize that the above claims often suggest the dualistic or bridging positions held by frameworks, in both theory building and for guiding empirical observations. However, there is relatively little discussion in the above literature on how frameworks act as bridging tools within a theory of science or how frameworks add value as positioning tools in a field. @partelow2023framework*

*As positioning tools, frameworks seem to "populate the scientist's world with a set of conceptual objects and (non-causal) relationships among them," shaping (and sometimes limiting) the way we think about problems and potential solutions (Cox et al. 2016, 47). Thus, using a specific framework helps in part to position the work of a researcher in a field and its related concepts, theories and paradigms @partelow2023framework*

*Frameworks are important research tools across nearly all fields of science. They are critically important for structuring empirical inquiry and theoretical development in the environmental social sciences, governance research and practice, the sustainability sciences and fields of social-ecological systems research in tangent with the associated disciplines of those fields @partelow2023framework*

*Many well-established frameworks are regularly applied to collect new data or to structure entire research programs such as the Ecosystem Services (ES) framework ...(...) Frameworks are also put forth by major scientific organizing bodies to steer scientific and policy agendas at regional and global levels such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) @partelow2023framework*

*the role of frameworks as integral but often vague scientific tools, highlighting benefits and critiques. While frameworks can be useful for synthesizing and communicat- ing core concepts in a field, they often lack transparency in how they were developed and how they can be applied (...) This article provides a meta-framework for visualizing and engaging the four mediating processes for framework development and application: (1) empirical generalization, (2) theoretical fitting, (3) application, and (4) hypothesizing @partelow2023framework*

*Despite the countless frameworks, it is not always clear how a framework can be developed or applied (Ban and Cox 2017; Partelow 2018; Nagel and Partelow 2022). Develop- ment may occur through empirically backed synthesis or by scholars based on their own knowledge, values, or interests. These diverse development pathways do, however, result in common trends. @partelow2023framework*

*The structure of most frameworks is the identification of a set of concepts and their general relation- ships --- often in the form box-and-arrow diagrams --- that are loosely defined or unspecified. This hallmark has both benefits and challenges. On one hand, this is arguably the purpose of frameworks, to structure the basic ideas of theory or conceptual thinking, and if they were more detailed they would be models. On the other hand, there is often a "black box" nature to frameworks. It is often unclear why some sets of concepts and relationships are chosen for integration into frameworks, and others not. @partelow2023framework*

*Now shifting focus to how frameworks are applied. Some frameworks provide measureable indicators as the key variables in the framework, but many only suggest general concepts. This creates the need to link concepts and their relationships to data through other more tangible indicators (...) These methodologi- cal and study design steps necessary to associate data to framework concepts is often referred to as "operational- izing" a framework. However, without guidance on how to do this, scholars are often left with developing their own strategies, which can lead to heterogeneous and idiosyn- cratic methods and data.(...) This is not necessarily a problem if the purpose of a framework is to only guide the analysis of individual cases or synthesis activities in isolation, for example to inform local manage- ment, but it hinders meta-analyses, cross-case learning and data interpretability for others @partelow2023framework*

*From the conceptually broadest to the most empirically specific, we can identify the following levels of theory: paradigms, frameworks, specific theories, models/ archetypes and cases (Table 1).(...) (whereby Frameworks:) Organize diagnostic, descriptive, and prescriptive inquiry, providing the basic vocabulary of concepts and terms to construct the causal explanations expected of a theory. @partelow2023framework*

*There is a need to connect cases, models and specific theory up to the overall paradigms of a field to make aggregate knowledge gains. Here, the role of frame- works becomes more clear, as bridging tools that enable connections between levels of knowledge. From the top down, frameworks can specify paradigms with more tangible conceptual features and relationships, which can then guide empirical inquiry @partelow2023framework*

*Furthermore, frameworks can also emerge from the bottom up, by distilling empirical data across cases and thus creating a knowledge bridge of more specified conceptual features and relationships that connect to a paradigm. In both top-down and bottom-up mechanism, frameworks can play a vital role in synthesizing and communicating ideas among scholars in a field --- from empirical data to a paradigm. A challenge may be, how- ever, that multiple frameworks have emerged attempting to specify the core conceptual features and relationships in a paradigm. A mature scientific field is likely to have many frameworks to guide research and debate. There is, however, a lack of research and tools available to com- pare frameworks and their added value @partelow2023framework*

*Beyond their use as positioning tools, frameworks make day-to-day science easier. They can guide researchers in designing new empirical research by indicating which core concepts and relationships are of interest to be meas- ured and compared.Scientific fields also need common fires to huddle around, meaning that we need reference points to initiate scholarly debates, coordinate disparate empirical efforts and to communicate findings and novel advancements through a common language. As such, frameworks are useful for synthesis research, focusing the attention of reviews and meta-analyses around core sets of concepts and relationships. @partelow2023framework*

*There is, however, a tension between frameworks that aim to capture complexity and those that aim to simplify core principles. Complexity oriented frameworks often advance systems thinking at the risk of including too many variables. They often have long lists of variables which makes empirical orientation and synthesis difficult. On the other hand, simplification frameworks face the challenge of leaving important things out, with the benefit of clarifying what may be important and giving clear direction @partelow2023framework*

*There has undoubtedly been a rise in the number of frameworks, but as expressed by Ban and Cox (2017, 2), "it is not clear what the role of a scien- tific framework should be, and relatedly, what makes for a successful scientific framework. Although there are many frameworks \[...\] there is little discussion on what their scientific role ought to be, other than providing a common scientific language."@partelow2023framework*

*(ver el meta-framework que proponen los autores) In the center, frameworks provide two core bridging values: knowledge synthesis and knowledge communication. Three modes of logical reasoning contribute to framework development: induction, deduction and abduction. Frameworks are used and developed through four mediating processes: (1) empirical generalization, (2) theoretical fitting, (3) application, and (4) hypothesizing @partelow2023framework*

*(esta explicación aunque se refiere al meta-framwork que ellos proponen lo puedo utilizar para justiciar el mío) The meta-framework can further help identify the posi- tioning of framework such as the type of logical reason- ing processes used to create it, as well as help clarify the role of a framework along the scale of knowledge production (i.e., from data to paradigm). It might be clear, for example, what paradigm or specific theory a framework contributes to. The meta-framework can add value by guiding the assessment of how frameworks fit into the bigger picture of knowledge contribution in their field. Furthermore, many scholars and practitioners are interested in developing new frameworks. The meta- framework outlines the mechanisms that can be considered in creating the framework as well as help developers of new frameworks communicate how their frameworks add value. For example, to link empirical data collection to theoretical work in their field. The meta-framework can help compare frameworks, to assess strengths and weaknesses in terms of their positioning and knowledge production mechanisms. It can also help elucidate the need for, or value of, new frameworks. This challenge is noted by Cumming (2014, 18) in the field of social-ecological systems, reflect- ing that "the tendency of researchers to develop"new" frameworks without fully explaining how they relate to other existing frameworks and what new elements they bring to the problem is another obvious reason for the lack of a single dominant, unifying framework." @partelow2023framework*

*However, reflection on the role and purpose of the frameworks we use needs to be a more common practice in science. The proposed meta-framework aims to showcase the role of frameworks as boundary objects that connect ideas and concepts to data in constructive and actionable ways, enabling knowledge to be built up and aggregated within scientific fields through using common languages and concepts (Mollinga 2008; Klein 1996).\@partelow2023framework*

*Boundary objects such as frameworks can be especially important for inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration, where there may be few prior shared points of conceptual understanding or terminology beyond a problem context. Mollinga (2008, 33) reflects that "frameworks are typical examples of boundary objects, building con- nections between the worlds of science and that of policy, and between different knowledge domains," and that "the development of frameworks is at present probably the most common strategy in the field of natural resources management to achieve integration and interdisciplinar- ity," (Mollinga, 2008, 31). (...) translating often esoteric academic concepts and findings into digestible and often visual objects.(...) Partelow et al., (2019) and Gurney et al., (2019) both use Ostrom's SESF (Box 2) as a boundary object at the science-society interface to visually communicate systems thinking and social-ecological interactions to fishers and coastal stakeholders involved in local management decision-making. @partelow2023framework*

*A framework can only be an effective boundary object if it catalyzes deliberation and scholarly debate --- thus contestation over what it is and its value is seeded into the toolbox and identity of a scholarly field. Although most frameworks are likely to have shortcomings, flaws or controversial features, the fact that they motivate engagement around common problems and stimulate scholarly engagement is a value of its own. In doing so, frameworks often become symbols of individual and community identity in contested spaces.(...) Citing a framework both communicates the general purpose of what a scholar is attempting to achieve to others, and orients science towards a common synthetic object for future knowledge synthesis and debate @partelow2023framework*

*Frameworks can act as tools for bridging disciplines, helping to catalyze interdisciplinary engagement (Mollinga 2008; Klein 1996). As many scientific communities shift focus towards solving real- world problems (e.g., climate change, gender equality), tools that can help scientists' cooperate and communicate, such as a framework, will continue to play a vital role in achieving knowledge co-production goals. @partelow2023framework*

*Frameworks have gained substantial popularity for the communication and synthesis of academic ideas, and as tools we all have the ability to create and perhaps the responsibility to steward. However, frameworks have struggled to find roots in a theory of science which grounds their contributions in relation to other scientific tools such as models, specific theories and empirical data.*

**(OJO, a tener en cuenta!) Table 4 Guiding points for future framework engagement, separated by development (or modification) and application**

## Why a meta-framework?Reasons to Choose Framework Analysis

*We independently chose the framework approach to underpin data analysis for a range of reasons. First, the framework approach is particularly suited to the analysis of cross-sectional descriptive data enabling different aspects of the phenomena under investigation to be captured (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). Second, one of the advantages of the framework approach is that researchers' interpretations of participants' experiences are transparent (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). Third, for novice researchers moving from data management to developing the analysis sufficiently to answer the research questions posed can be a daunting and bewildering task. The interconnected stages within the framework approach explicitly describe the processes that guide the systematic analysis of data from the development of descriptive to explanatory accounts. @smith2011qualitative*

*The authors chose the framework synthesis approach because a published model was identified from the literature that conceptualised attitudes of adult women to the taking of vitamins and minerals \[16\]. The approach therefore was augmentative and deductive (building on this existing model or framework), rather than grounded or inductive (starting with a completely blank sheet).(...) The model identified did not entirely match the topic under study, but it was a "best-fit" and provided a relevant pre-existing framework and themes against which to map and code the data from the studies identified for this review. A list of themes was derived from this model (see Figure 1) and provided the a priori framework of themes against which to code the data extracted from the included studies. @carroll2011worked*

### Characteristics

In **epistemological terms**, if we consider at two ends of the spectrum, one a highly constructivist vision of knowledge, and at the other, an unproblematized vision of knowledge as an "objective window open to the world," the framework synthesis, although still implies a certain interpretation of the data, shares the attributes of critical realism where knowledge of reality is mediated by our perceptions and beliefs. Furthermore, its synthesis results are reproducible and correspond to a shareable objective reality.

Regarding the extent of iteration during the review process, framework analysis involves an iterative process of searching the literature.

Assessing quality is a key component in the review process of framework analysis. Typically, when performing a framework analysis, quality criteria are set for the selection of literature. Those studies that do not meet a certain number of the criteria are excluded.

Framework analysis focuses on describing and summarising their primary data (often in a highly structured and detailed way) and translating the studies into one another. However, it also seeks to push beyond the original data to a fresh interpretation of the phenomena under review.

With regards of the synthetic product, namely, what is the synthesis for? It is clear that framework analysis views itself as producing an output that is directly applicable to policy makers and designers of interventions. There are a few framework synthesis which involved policy makers and practitioners in directing the focus of the synthesis and used the themes derived from the synthesis to infer what kind of interventions might be most effective in encouraging walking and cycling. Likewise, the products of the thematic synthesis took the form of practical recommendations for interventions (e.g. „do not promote fruit and vegetables in the same way in the same intervention‟).

*There are a number of approaches to qualitative data analysis, including those that pay close attention to language and how it is being used in social interaction such as discourse analysis \[15\] and ethnomethodology \[16\]; those that are concerned with experience, meaning and language such as phenomenology \[17,18\] and narrative methods \[19\]; and those that seek to develop theory derived from data through a set of procedures and interconnected stages such as Grounded Theory \[20,21\]. Many of these approaches are associated with specific disciplines and are underpinned by philosophical ideas which shape the process of analysis \[22\]. The Framework Method, however, is not aligned with a particular epistemological, philosophical, or theoretical approach. Rather it is a flexible tool that can be adapted for use with many qualitative approaches that aim to generate themes. gale2013using*

*Framework analysis operates from a pragmatic epistemology and can be applied to a variety of types of data and be employed for a variety of reasons (King & Brooks, 2018; Spencer, Ritchie, Ormston, et al., 2014). Data types used in framework analysis have included in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, observational data, policy documents, online discussion board posts, photographs, and case studies (Johnston et al., 2014; Mason et al., 2018; Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Roberts, 2000; Robertshaw & Cross, 2019; Struik & Baskerville, 2014; Tallentire et al., 2015; Tishelman et al., 2016). Approaches to framework analysis in applied research have varied from highly deductive analysis of fairly structured data (Pope et al., 2000) to inductively-oriented theory-building work for knowledge users, such as policy makers and health care providers (e.g., Goldsmith et al., 2017; Swallow et al., 2011).\@goldsmith2021using*

*Glossary of key terms used in the Framework Method* @gale2013using *Analytical framework: A set of codes organised into categories that have been jointly developed by researchers involved in analysis that can be used to manage and organise the data. The framework creates a new structure for the data (rather than the full original accounts given by participants) that is helpful to summarize/reduce the data in a way that can support answering the research questions*

**Structured Review of Key Existing Frameworks**

*As can be seen from the above, assessing skills/competence frameworks is not a simple task.*

*In this situation the Workshop has examined tools that can help in the structured review of what is currently available. These tools are essentially of two kinds:*

*• "top-down" approaches, where the main characteristics of the different frameworks are presented in what might be viewed as a structured inventory -- drawing on Dutch experience with the Generic Referential ICT Profiles (GRIP) approach (Hacquebard, 2005) , and*

*• "bottom-up" approaches, where each profile specification is analysed in terms of the underlying units of competence, skills and knowledge (the e-Competences and Certifications Observatory (eCCO) project, researching the use of "Knowledge Objects" as the "underlying unit", leads developments here). A summary of the principles of the eCCO approach is presented in Annex G.*

*This CWA uses the Top-down approach, but supports the development of complementary Bottom-up approaches as potentially providing more rigorous analysis for comparison and design. In particular completion of the eCCO approach in this regard is awaited with interest @de2006european*

### Differences with other methods

#### Differences with systematic review

Meta-synthesis and systematic literature review are both methods used in qualitative research to synthesize findings from multiple studies, but they differ in their objectives, approaches, and synthesis techniques. Here are the key differences between meta-synthesis and systematic literature review:

1.  **Objective**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: The primary objective of meta-synthesis is to integrate and interpret qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new understandings, theories, or conceptual frameworks. Meta-synthesis aims to generate insights that go beyond the individual studies and provide a deeper understanding of the research topic.
    -   Systematic literature review: The primary objective of a systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a particular topic. It aims to summarize and critically evaluate the findings of relevant studies, identify gaps or inconsistencies in the literature, and provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge.
2.  **Approach**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: Meta-synthesis typically involves a qualitative analysis approach, where researchers extract, analyze, and interpret qualitative data from multiple studies. It often involves thematic analysis, constant comparison, or other qualitative synthesis techniques to identify common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies.
    -   Systematic literature review: Systematic literature reviews can involve both qualitative and quantitative research methods, depending on the nature of the research question and available literature. They follow a systematic and transparent process for searching, selecting, appraising, and synthesizing studies, often using predetermined criteria and structured data extraction forms.
3.  **Synthesis technique**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: In meta-synthesis, researchers synthesize qualitative findings from multiple studies to develop new interpretations, theories, or frameworks. This synthesis may involve identifying common themes, patterns, or concepts across studies, as well as exploring relationships, contradictions, or divergent perspectives within the data.
    -   Systematic literature review: In a systematic literature review, the synthesis may involve summarizing and categorizing the findings of included studies, identifying trends or patterns in the data, and providing a narrative or descriptive synthesis of the literature. The focus is on summarizing and synthesizing existing knowledge rather than generating new interpretations or theories.
4.  **Output**:
    -   Meta-synthesis: The output of a meta-synthesis is often a synthesized framework, model, or theory that integrates findings from multiple qualitative studies. This output provides a deeper understanding of the research topic and may generate new insights or perspectives.
    -   Systematic literature review: The output of a systematic literature review is typically a comprehensive summary of the existing literature, including key findings, trends, gaps, and recommendations for future research. It provides a snapshot of the current state of knowledge on the topic and may inform practice, policy, or further research.

In summary, while both meta-synthesis and systematic literature review involve synthesizing findings from multiple studies, they differ in their objectives, approaches, synthesis techniques, and output. Meta-synthesis aims to develop new interpretations or frameworks based on qualitative data, while systematic literature reviews provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on a topic.

#### Similarities with other quality approaches

*The Framework Method sits within a broad family of analysis methods often termed thematic analysis or qualitative content analysis. These approaches identify commonalities and differences in qualitative data, before focusing on relationships between different parts of the data, thereby seeking to draw descriptive and/or explanatory conclusions clustered around themes @gale2013using*

-   Thematic analysis @stevens2022qualitative *for Boyatzis, the aim of a TA is not only to identify themes, measure their frequency (e.g., by number of cases), or cluster them in groups, but also to detect relationships among them. You might therefore start by trying to understand if there is a relationship among specific themes and what type of relationship that is. Once you identify a relationship among themes, you for- malize this relationship into a meta-theme. If two or more themes are brought together in a meta-theme, you will then aim to understand what that meta-theme is about and interpret how it might help you to further understand the phenomenon that you are studying*

*Framework analysis is an inherently comparative form of thematic analysis which employs an organized structure of inductively- and deductively-derived themes (i.e., a framework) to conduct cross-sectional analysis using a combination of data description and abstraction. @goldsmith2021using*

*Generating themes from data is a common feature of qualitative methods and a widely used analytical method. Thematic analysis is an interpretive process, whereby data is systematically searched to identify patterns within the data in order to provide an illuminating description of the phenomenon. The process results in the development of meaningful themes without explicitly generating theory (Tesch 1990). Thematic analysis can provide rich and insightful understandings of complex phenomena, be applied across a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches, and expand on or test existing theory (Braun and Clark 2006). However, thematic analysis has been criticised for lacking depth, fragmenting the phenomena being studied, being subjective and lacking transparency in relation to the development of themes, which can result in difficulties when judging the rigour of the findings (Attride-Stirling 2001). @smith2011qualitative*

*The framework approach has many similarities to thematic analysis, particularly in the initial stages when recurring and significant themes are identified. However, analytical frameworks such as thematic networks and the framework approach appear to have a greater emphasis (...) on making the process of data analysis transparent and illustrating the linkage between the stages of the analysis (Pope et al 2000, Ritchie and Lewis 2003, Braun and Clark 2006). Central to the analytical processes within the framework approach is a series of interconnected stages that enables the researcher to move back and forth across the data until a coherent account emerges (Ritchie and Lewis 2003). This results in the constant refinement of themes which may lead to the development of a conceptual framework. @smith2011qualitative*

-   Content analysis @stevens2022qualitative *'research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of manifest content'*

-   Meta-synthesis *Thematic analysis (TA) is a technique for the analysis of qualitative data which allows you to identify or develop patterns of meaning and/or central ideas that unify them (referred to as themes) pertaining to a given set of data. You will then use these themes to organize, describe or interpret (perceptions of) reality (Boyatzis, 1998; Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2021). Once (relationships among) themes are identified, you need to interpret their relevance and implications for the research question you aim to answer. Verbal individual or group interviews (see King et al. 2018), focus group data (see Barbour, 2008) or textual data (written material) are usually at the core of thematic research. Nevertheless, video material and images might also be thematically analysed (Joffe, 2012).\@stevens2022qualitative*

### Inductive vs Deductive Approach

*However, the tool itself has no allegiance to either inductive or deductive thematic analysis; where the research sits along this inductive-deductive continuum depends on the research question.\@gale2013using*

*The differencewould become apparent in how themes are selected: in the deductive approach, themes and codes are pre-selected based on previous literature, previous theories or the specifics of the research question; whereas in the inductive approach, themes are generated from the data though open (unrestricted) coding, followed by refinement of themes. In many cases, a combined approach is appropriate when the project has some specific issues to explore, but also aims to leave space to discover other unexpected aspects of the participants' experience or the way they assign meaning to phenomena. In sum, the Framework Method can be adapted for use with deductive, inductive, or combined types of qualitative analysis.\@gale2013using*

## Key steps of meta-framework

*'Frame work' is an analytical process which involves a number of distinct though highly interconnected stages. Although the process is presented as following a particular order---indeed some stages do logically precede others ---there is no implication that 'Framework' is a purely mechanical process, a foolproof recipe with a guaranteed outcome. On the contrary, although systematic and disciplined, it relies on the creative and conceptual ability of the analyst to determine meaning, salience and connections. Real leaps in analytical thinking often involve both jumping ahead and returning to rework earlier ideas. The strength of an approach like 'Framework' is that by following a well-defined procedure, it is possible to reconsider and rework ideas precisely because the analytical process has been documented and is therefore accessible. The approach involves a systematic process of sifting, charting and sorting material according to key issues and themes. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*it is worth taking a step back to consider briefly what needs to happen before analysis begins. The selection of analysis method should have been considered at the proposal stage of the research and should fit with the research questions and overall aims of the study (...) At this early stage it is also useful to consider whether the team will use Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), which can assist with data management and analysis. @gale2013using*

*As any form of qualitative or quantitative analysis is not a purely technical process, but influenced by the characteristics of the researchers and their disciplinary paradigms, critical reflection throughout the research process is paramount, including in the design of the study, the construction or collection of data, and the analysis. All @gale2013using*

*It is important to remember when using the Framework Method that, unlike quantitative research where data collection and data ana- lysis are strictly sequential and mutually exclusive stages of the research process, in qualitative analysis there is, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the project, ongoing interplay between data collection, analysis, and theory development. For example, new ideas or insights from participants may suggest potentially fruitful lines of enquiry, or close analysis might reveal subtle inconsistencies in an account which require further exploration. \@gale2013using*

Here are the key steps involved in conducting a meta-framework analysis:

1.  **Identify relevant studies**: Conduct a systematic search to identify qualitative studies related to the research topic. These studies may employ different theoretical frameworks, methodologies, or perspectives.

2.  **Extract data**: Extract relevant data from each included study, including key concepts, themes, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies used.

3.  **Code and categorize**: Analyze the extracted data by coding and categorizing the concepts, themes, and frameworks identified in the included studies. This process involves identifying similarities and differences across the studies.

4.  **Develop a meta-framework**: Based on the coded data, develop a meta-framework that integrates the key concepts, themes, and theoretical frameworks identified in the included studies. The meta-framework should capture the overarching structure or framework that emerges from the synthesis of the individual studies.

5.  **Refine the meta-framework**: Iteratively refine the meta-framework by revisiting the coded data and ensuring that it accurately represents the diversity of perspectives and theories present in the included studies.

6.  **Analyze relationships**: Analyze the relationships between different elements of the meta-framework, such as how concepts and themes from different theoretical frameworks relate to each other or intersect.

7.  **Interpret findings**: Interpret the findings of the meta-framework analysis in relation to the research question or objective. Discuss the implications of the synthesized framework for theory, practice, and future research.

8.  **Report results**: Write up the results of the meta-framework analysis, describing the methodology used, presenting the synthesized framework, and providing supporting evidence from the included studies.

Meta-framework analysis offers a systematic approach to synthesizing qualitative research findings from diverse theoretical perspectives and methodologies. By integrating these perspectives into a cohesive framework, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field.

*The five key stages to qualitative data analysis involved in 'Framework' are: familiarization, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting, mapping and interpretation (this being the stage at which the key objectives of qualitative analysis are addressed). @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Familiarization* *Before beginning the process of sifting and sorting data, the researcher must become familiar with their range and diversity, must gain an overview of the body of material gathered. Although she or he will have been involved in some, if not all, of the data collection, and will have formed hunches about key issues and emergent themes, it is important at this stage to set these firmly in context by taking stock and gaining a feel for the material as a whole (...) Essentially, familiarization involves immersion in the data: listening to tapes, reading transcripts, studying observational notes. In some cases it is possible to review all the material at the familiarization stage, for example where only a few interviews have been carried out, or where there is a generous timetable for the research. However, more often than not in applied policy research, the timetable is too pressing or the volume of material too extensive, and a selection must be made for this initial stage. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*When making a selection, it is important to ensure that a range of different cases, sources, and time periods are reviewed (...) During the familiarization stage, the analyst listens to and reads through the material, listing key ideas and recurrent themes @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Identifying a thematic framework* *During the familiarization stage, the analyst is not only gaining an overview of the richness, depth, and diversity of the data, but also beginning the process of abstraction and conceptualization. While reviewing the material, the analyst will be making notes, recording the range of responses to questions posed by the researchers themselves, jotting down recurrent themes and issues which emerge as important to respondents themselves.Once the selected material has been reviewed, the analyst returns to these research notes, and attempts to identify the key issues, concepts and themes, according to which the data can be examined and referenced. That is, she or he sets up a thematic framework within which the material can be sifted and sorted. When identifying and constructing this framework or index, the researcher will be drawing upon a priori issues (those informed by the original research aims and introduced into the interviews via the topic guide), emergent issues raised by the respondents themselves, and analytical themes arising from the recurrence or patterning of particular views or experiences. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*The first version of an index is often largely descriptive and heavily rooted in a priori issues. It is then applied to a few transcripts when categories will be refined and become more responsive to emergent and analytical themes. For these refinements, the researcher looks for conceptualizations which encapsulate and represent diversity of experience, attitude, circumstance, etc. Devising and refining a thematic framework is not an automatic or mechanical process, but involves both logical and intuitive thinking. It involves making judgements about meaning, about the relevance and importance of issues, and about implicit connections between ideas. In applied social policy research, it also involves making sure that the original research questions are being fully addressed. (...) Indexes provide a mechanism for labelling data in manageable 'bites' for subsequent retrieval and exploration. They should therefore not be over-elaborate in detail at this stage as the analyst needs to retain an overview of all the categories. The more interpretative stages of analysis, which take place later, will produce the refinement of what is contained in each category. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Indexing* *'Indexing' refers to the process whereby the thematic framework or index is systematically applied to the data in its textual form.(...) applying an index is not a routine exercise as it involves making numerous judgements as to the meaning and significance of the data. For each passage, the analyst must infer and decide on its meaning, both as it stands and in the context of the interview as a whole, and must record the appropriate indexing reference.(...) Of course, this process of making judgements is subjective, and open to differing interpretations. By adopting a system of annotating the textual data, however, the process is made visible and accessible to others; others can see for themselves how the data are being sifted and organized, research colleagues can 'try out' the framework and pool their experiences; the analyst can 'check out' the basis of his or her assumptions. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*In Figure 9.3, it is possible to see that several different index prefixes appear on one page, even within one speech passage (e.g. 4.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.4). It is quite common to find that different major topics are connected and interwoven in this way and this is one of the values of indexing. Once labelled, the analyst is able to access each reference and, more crucially, to see patterns and the contexts in which they arise. As already suggested, these juxtapositions are often one of the early clues to associations for subsequent stages of analysis @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Charting* *Having applied the thematic framework to individual transcripts, the analyst needs to build up a picture of the data as a whole, by considering the range of attitudes and experience for each issue or theme. Data are 'lifted' from their original context and rearranged according to the appropriate thematic reference. This process, referred to as charting, is described below @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Mapping and interpretation* *When all the data have been sifted and charted according to core themes, the analyst begins to pull together key characteristics of the data, and to map and interpret the data set as a whole. Although emergent categories, associations and patterns will have been noted and recorded during the indexing and charting phases, the serious and systematic process of detection now begins.(...) It is here that the analyst returns to the key objectives and features of qualitative analysis outlined at the beginning of this chapter, namely: defining concepts, mapping range and nature of phenomena, creating typologies, finding associations, providing explanations, developing strategies, etc (ojo, cada uno de estos está explicado en el capítulo de Ritchie)@ritchie2002qualitative*

*(...) Which of these the analyst chooses to attempt will be guided by the original research questions to be addressed, and by the themes and associations which have emerged from the data themselves. Whichever route is followed, the basic processes are the same: the analyst reviews the charts and research notes; compares and contrasts the perceptions, accounts, or experiences; searches for patterns and connections and seeks explanations for these internally within the data. Piecing together the overall picture is not simply a question of aggregating patterns, but of weighing up the salience and dynamics of issues, and searching for a structure rather than a multiplicity of evidence. @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Conclusion* *The method, of course, needs to be adapted to suit the aims and coverage of a specific piece of research, but it has proved flexible for a range of different types of studies. It has been applied to in-depth and group interviewing, longitudinal studies, case studies, and projects involving different groups or subpopulations of participants. 'Framework' has also been successfully used jointly by two or more researchers working on a single project, in some cases cross-institutionally @ritchie2002qualitative*

*Framework analysis consists of two major components: creating an analytic framework and applying this analytic framework. These two major components occur through five steps: (1) data familiarization; (2) identifying a thematic framework; (3) indexing all study data against the framework; (4) charting to summarize the indexed data; and (5) mapping and interpretation of patterns found within the charts (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). The hallmarks of framework analysis are found in the last three steps, namely the emphasis on systematic and comprehensive indexing across all the data (in step 3), the intentional organizing of the indexed data into a matrix format (in step 4), and comparative analysis within this matrix format to identify key patterns and abstractions (in step 5). @goldsmith2021using*

*The framework approach has five stages (which share features of both the comparative and translational approaches to interpretive synthesis described above):* *1 familiarisation with the data and/or studies (i.e. reading and re-reading)* *2 identification of a thematic framework, typically derived form the research questions* *3 indexing or coding of the data/ and/or studies* *4 charting (i.e. transfer of summaries to matrix displays)* *5 mapping and interpretation* @mays2007synthesizing

*Step 1: Data Familiarization As the first step in the analysis, data familiarization provides the researcher with an initial, purposeful understanding of the data. Through immersion in the data and making notes about key ideas, the researcher begins to understand major themes in the data. Items that could be major themes include topics or issues that relate to the research question(s) and recur across the data. The data familiarization step continues until the researcher feels they have arrived at a reasonable initial understanding of the data, including the breadth of variation within the data (Spencer, Ritchie, O'Connor, et al., 2014) (...) the dataset volume or study timelines require purposeful sampling from the study dataset for the data familiarization step (...) Coding can be a part of the data familiarization process, but it is not required. Some researchers like to immediately start working with preliminary codes linked to data at this early stage, even if they are later deleted or heavily reworked. Other researchers prefer to take notes about their thoughts about and understanding of the data without explicitly linking these thoughts to portions of the data. Understanding major themes in the data---the desired outcome of the data familiarization stage---is not dependent on coding at this stage. @goldsmith2021using*

*Step 2: Framework Identification This second step moves the analysis from concrete descriptions of themes in the data to the identification of more abstract concepts, with the objective of providing a framework, or a structure for the analysis and the resulting interpretation. This framework or analytic structure is usually built from a combination of a priori and emergent concepts and themes (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). These themes and concepts are then grouped, ranked, or otherwise ordered in a way that helps the researcher address the focus of the study. Typically, frameworks are composed of major themes and concepts (hereafter called components), which are supported by other themes and concepts elaborating on or sub-dividing the major themes and concepts (hereafter called sub-components). Like many other forms of qualitative analysis, the typical framework structure can be thought of as a tree with many branches.(...) the identifying the framework step is an iterative process. An initial framework is tested against a manageable portion of the data and refined as necessary to move from simple description to conceptual abstractions (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). Refinements can include renaming components, identifying new components, deleting components, collapsing components, and reordering components. Similar refinements can also occur at the sub-component level. @goldsmith2021using*

*The development of themes is a common feature of qualitative data analysis, involving the systematic search for patterns to generate full descriptions capable of shedding light on the phenomenon under investigation. In particular, many qualitative approaches use the 'constant comparative method', developed as part of Grounded Theory, which involves making systematic comparisons across cases to refine each theme \[21,23\]. Unlike Grounded Theory, the Framework Method is not necessarily concerned with generating social theory, but can greatly facilitate constant comparative techniques through the review of data across the matrix.\@gale2013using*

*I then worked through the three focus group transcripts, attaching text in the transcripts to the draft framework using a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) program. I created new framework components when I encountered text that did not fit the draft framework yet would be helpful for understanding the two provider types and the birth process. I also created sub-components where I felt it would be helpful to develop a more nuanced understanding of the data for this step. This approach resulted in the addition of sub- components throughout the framework plus two additional framework components (right column of Table 2). I considered whether I should reorder the components from the initial framework but did not see an obvious new order. I also knew that I could revisit the consideration of reordering through the next step.\@goldsmith2021using*

*Coding is a common part of the framework identification stage, although it is possible to arrive at a well-functioning framework without having engaged in explicit coding work. The emphasis at this stage is on completing the framework---the identification of the important themes and concepts and the conceptual relationship they have to each other---rather than an emphasis on how the important themes and concepts play out in the data. For identifying the framework in the TBA dataset, I chose to engage in explicit coding as I wanted a stronger handle on the data and the patterns within. I also chose to initiate this coding with a CAQDAS program rather than via pen and paper as I expected I would want the flexibility to quickly reorder, collapse, and split codes as my understanding of the data deepened. Had I been involved in the study design and data collection phases of the TBA study, I might have started the framework identification step with a strong grasp of the data and opted to complete the entirety of this step using pen and paper and without much explicit coding work .\@goldsmith2021using*

*Step 3: Indexing Once a reasonable framework has been identified, the next step in framework analysis is to systematically apply the framework to all of the study data (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). This process is called indexing as it resembles the process used to create the index of a book (Spencer, Ritchie, O'Connor, et al., 2014). The linking of study data and framework components can be accomplished using any approach with which the researcher is comfortable for coding data (e.g., pen and paper, using the comment function in a word processing program, or a CAQDAS program). Many researchers with access to a CAQDAS program will opt to use it at this stage to facilitate the data manipulation required in framework analysis' subsequent steps (...) Before indexing can begin, the researcher must determine the appropriate way to link framework components with applicable study data. There is no standard linking structure to rely on like the page numbers in a book index. Rather, the study data are linked to framework components via the appropriate units of analysis---namely, the entities or items which are the focus of the study framework. For some frameworks, the data collection sampling units can also be used as the units of analysis. Other frameworks operate at a different altitude with respect to the study topic than was the case during the study's initial design or data collection phases, necessitating using units of analysis which differ from the data collection sampling units. (See Goldsmith et al., 2017 for an example of framework analysis using units of analysis which differ from the data collection sampling units @goldsmith2021using*

*The indexing step also provides an important opportunity for framework revision as applying the framework to all study data simultaneously necessitates assessing how well the framework works with and for the study data. Framework testing and revision tasks in the indexing step consist of affirming and amending the definitions and boundaries of each framework component and sub-component and adding to framework sub-components to accommodate new variation. The researcher may even encounter data in the indexing step for which the framework does not work, requiring revisiting the overall structure and contents of the framework. Regardless of what revisions are made, framework indexing and revision must continue in an iterative process until all data are indexed on the final framework.(...) By this point in time, I knew that the framework worked for all the data and I made no revisions to the framework. This is an unusual situation and readers should more often expect that indexing will be accomplished as a distinct step after framework identification and the framework is likely to be refined during the indexing step. @goldsmith2021using*

*Step 4: Charting The next step in framework analysis is a process of ordering and abstracting the now-indexed study data such that the data can be examined systematically and in totality. This is accomplished through creating one or more charts summarizing the study data. The chart(s) are organized in a matrix form, using ordered rows and columns populated by the units of analysis and the framework components. Although charting is primarily focused on summarizing the study data, charting is also dependent on the work done in the earlier steps of framework analysis. The act of charting is an opportunity to revisit and enhance earlier decisions around the appropriate units of analysis, the order of units of analysis and framework components, the appropriate level of data abstraction, and the adequacy of the framework for the data at hand (...) With respect to revisiting and enhancing decisions around the appropriate units of analysis, charting the indexed study data may make it obvious that it is not possible to carry forward one or more of the units of analysis from the indexing step. For @goldsmith2021using*

*With respect to revisiting and enhancing the order of units of analysis and framework components, charting demands an explicit order to the layout of rows and columns. The researcher may not have needed to be concerned about imposing order on the units of analysis before now---data may have been indexed in the order that individuals were interviewed, for instance. And while framework components are more likely to already have order suggested by the earlier framework identification and indexing steps, the act of charting can still push the researcher to enhance the order of framework components. Regardless of the state of order of units of analysis and framework components prior to this step, the researcher uses the research questions and the developing analysis to ensure there is explicit and sufficient order to the units of analysis and framework components on the chart(s). Imposing order can be simple, such as grouping units of analysis by key characteristics. @goldsmith2021using*

*Once the charting structure of the rows and columns is established, the researcher can move onto populating the interior cells of the chart(s). This requires reviewing the data in its indexed form (Spencer, Ritchie, O'Connor, et al., 2014) and determining or revisiting the appropriate level of abstraction for the data.\@goldsmith2021using*

*Researchers use a variety of approaches to create the chart or charts for their framework analyses. Some use pen and paper while others create charts using tables in word processing computer programs or spreadsheet computer programs (e.g., Swallow et al., 2003). Others use CAQDAS programs alone or in combination with aforementioned approaches to arrive at a completed chart (see Goldsmith et al., 2017 for an example of the latter). To the best of my knowledge, NVivo (version 9 and above) is the only CAQDAS program which facilitates the entirety of framework analysis, including charting, and allows for retaining live links between the cells in the chart and study data @goldsmith2021using*

*To create the chart for the TBA dataset, I reviewed the study data by framework component and stakeholder group within the CAQDAS program and then manually entered my summary of the data in the relevant cell on a table I created in a word processing program (Table 3). The framework continued to work well for the TBA data, and no new framework components or sub-components were added to the chart @goldsmith2021using*

*The charting step results in one or more charts, with the number of charts dependent on the data and the researcher's preferences. Where the data are not manageable in a single chart, for example, the researcher may subdivide the data by framework components or by units of analysis. For the TBA dataset, it was possible to use a single chart as the combination of each framework and charted data could be reasonably assessed as a single whole. @goldsmith2021using*

*Step 5: Mapping and Interpretation The final step in framework analysis---mapping and interpretation---is where the researcher combines the key learnings from the earlier steps, including hunches about patterns to explore in the data, with comparisons across and within units of analysis and across and within framework components. Comparisons of potential interest at this step include examining variation across the entire dataset, examining variation within subgroups and subthemes, and looking for clusters of data. The charts and other data are reviewed, recombined, collapsed, or condensed as suggested by the study focus, data, and major patterns. The researcher is ultimately trying to tell a compelling story about how the data are structured and patterned @goldsmith2021using*

*There is no single form of product from framework analysis. The results of mapping and interpretation can be shown in a variety of ways, including identifying and describing key concepts or the nature and range of particular phenomena; demonstrating associations across units of analysis for key concepts or particular phenomena; explaining attitudes, experiences and behaviors; and creating typologies (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). This list should not be seen as a complete list; the researcher is encouraged to be creative and follow the analysis to where the researcher is led even if the approach is not listed above. (See Ritchie & Spencer, 1994, for multiple varied examples of mapping and interpretation products). @goldsmith2021using*

EL marco de Gale et al. @gale2013using consiste en estas etapas: 1) Transcription, 2) Familiarisation with the interview, 3) Coding, 4) Developing a working analytical framework, 5) Applying the analytical framework, 6) Charting data into the framework matrix, 7) Interpreting the data

*Coding:* *In more inductive studies, at this stage 'open coding' takes place, i.e. coding anything that might be relevant from as many different perspectives as possible. Codes could refer to substantive things (e.g. particular behaviours, incidents or structures), values (e.g. those that inform or underpin certain statements, such as a belief in evidence-based medicine or in patient choice), emotions (e.g. sorrow, frustration, love) and more impressionistic/methodological elements (e.g. interviewee found something difficult to explain, interviewee became emotional, interviewer felt uncomfortable) \[33\]. In purely deductive studies, the codes may have been pre-defined (e.g. by an existing theory, or specific areas of interest to the project) so this stage may not be strictly necessary and you could just move straight onto indexing, although it is generally helpful even if you are taking a broadly deductive approach to do some open coding on at least a few of the transcripts to ensure important aspects of the data are not missed.\@gale2013using*

*Coding aims to classify all of the data so that it can be compared systematically with other parts of the data set. (...) Coding can also be done digitally using CAQDAS, which is a useful way to keep track automatically of new codes. However, some researchers prefer to do the early stages of coding with a paper and pen, and only start to use CAQDAS once they reach Stage 5 (see below) @gale2013using*

*Stage 4: Developing a working analytical framework After coding the first few transcripts, all researchers involved should meet to compare the labels they have applied and agree on a set of codes to apply to all subsequent transcripts. Codes can be grouped together into categories (using a tree diagram if helpful), which are then clearly defined. This forms a working analytical framework. It is likely that several iterations of the analytical framework will be required before no additional codes emerge (...) the analytical framework is never 'final' until the last transcript has been coded. @gale2013using*

*Stage 5: Applying the analytical framework The working analytical framework is then applied by indexing subsequent transcripts using the existing categories and codes. Each code is usually assigned a number or abbreviation for easy identification (and so the full names of the codes do not have to be written out each time) and written directly onto the transcripts. Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) is particularly useful at this stage because it can speed up the process and ensures that, at later stages, data is easily retrievable. It is worth noting that unlike software for statistical analyses, which actually carries out the calculations with the correct instruction, putting the data into a qualitative analysis soft- ware package does not analyse the data; it is simply an effective way of storing and organising the data so that they are accessible for the analysis process. @gale2013using*

*Stage 6: Charting data into the framework matrix Qualitative data are voluminous (an hour of interview can generate 15--30 pages of text) and being able to manage and summarize (reduce) data is a vital aspect of the analysis process. A spreadsheet is used to generate a matrix and the data are 'charted' into the matrix. Charting involves summarizing the data by category from each transcript. Good charting requires an ability to strike a balance between reducing the data on the one hand and retaining the original meanings and 'feel' of the interviewees' words on the other. The chart should include references to interesting or illustrative quotations. These can be tagged automatically if you are using CAQDAS to manage your data @gale2013using*

*Stage 7: Interpreting the data It is useful throughout the research to have a separate note book or computer file to note down impressions, ideas and early interpretations of the data. It may be worth breaking off at any stage to explore an interesting idea, concept or potential theme by writing an analytic memo \[20,21\] to then discuss with other members of the research team, including lay and clinical members (...) Gradually, characteristics of and differences between the data are identified, perhaps generating typologies, interrogating theoretical concepts (either prior concepts or ones emerging from the data) or mapping connections between categories to explore relationships and/or causality. If the data are rich enough, the findings generated through this process can go beyond description of particular cases to explanation of, for example, reasons for the emergence of a phenomena, predicting how an organisation or other social actor is likely to instigate or respond to a situation, or identifying areas that are not functioning well within an organisation or system. It is worth noting that this stage often takes longer than anticipated and that any project plan should ensure that sufficient time is allocated to meetings and individual researcher time to conduct interpretation and writing up of findings (see Additional file 1, Section 7). @gale2013using*

*the existing model acted as the basis for the synthesis and could be built-upon, expanded upon, reduced or added to by these new data. Each reviewer checked and examined critically the extraction and categorisation or coding of data performed by the other. The principal aim of this process was to examine the first reviewer's categorisation of the data, i.e. either to verify the coding or to challenge it by offering an alternative.(...) A consensus was reached on which a priori themes were supported by the data, and whether new themes identified by the reviewers did actually map either to a pre-existing theme or to one another (c.p. reciprocal translation \[2\]). The result was a finalised list of themes. The primary reviewer (CC) then offered an interpretation of the relationships between the themes based in part on the relationships as they were represented in the original model (see Figure 1), and also based on the data itself, which suggested, for example, that "the media" inputted into the central procedural themes of both perceived need and decision- making. The new model was then critically considered by all reviewers. A revised conceptual model was therefore developed building on the earlier, identified model, to describe and explain people's views around the taking of potential chemopreventive agents. @carroll2011worked*

*Data synthesis and development of model A combination of coding against pre-existing themes and the generation of and assignment of data to new, agreed themes, generated the model presented in Figure 2. A full description of the evidence supporting this model is published elsewhere \[8\]. @carroll2011worked (ver el framework que presenta en el artículo)*

*(esta es la referencia a la figura del cuadro con el Framework) The model describes the processes involved in an individual's decision about whether or not to take possible chemopreventive agents. The process runs from the first stages of perceived need, on the left, through the decision-making process itself, to final non- use or use, and maintenance of use, on the right.\@carroll2011worked*

*(y sigue la explicación comparando el Framework 1 obtenido de la literatura, con el Framework 2 que es al que llegan los autores) Since the source of the preliminary framework was a single published model, the manner in which new themes built-on, developed and altered this preliminary conceptual framework is quite transparent. In this review, this may be assessed in part by comparing Figure 1 with Figure 2. The principal procedural elements of the preliminary model also held true for this sample of studies and their population, i.e. the transition through the stages of perceived need, decision-making, risk versus benefit and use or non-use. These elements also reflect the three key stages of Contemplation,... @carroll2011worked*

*The a priori identification of these key constructs (en el Framework 1) therefore enabled therapid coding of studydatafromthisreviewagainst these tested and highly relevant components of health behaviour decision-making. The preliminary framework also provided "themes" that informed the "perceived need" and "decision-making" stages of the model (see numbers 1-9 in Figure 1). Once clear definitions had been applied to each of these themes, the study data were coded rapidly against them. Very little study data were coded against the themes of "Spending capacity" (or "Costs")and "Access: obtaining the agent",which may reflect differences in the cultural context of the preliminary conceptual model (a low-income country in South America) compared with the studies included in the review (principally UK, Europe and North America). However, relatively more substantial amounts of data were coded against the remaining themes. @carroll2011worked*

*Extension of the preliminary conceptual framework to generate the final model* *Despite these helpful overlaps, which permitted rapid and reliable coding of much data from the included stu- dies, the preliminary model lacked sufficient depth or complexity to explain all the data in the included studies. (... lo que sigue es el ejemplo de explicación) All of these characteristics were found in the included studies to affect perceived need and decision- making. It was felt that the pre-existing theme of "personal factors" alone was insufficient to illustrate the complexity of factors at play. The role of age, gender and the physical properties of agents were new factors identified by the synthesis affecting the a priori theme of use, which were absent from the original conceptual model. @carroll2011worked*

*(y sigue con la comparativa entre frameworks) Relationships between the themes were not well-developed in the preliminary model. The synthesis found that not only did family, physicians and others affect decision making, but also that this relationship was moderated by the credibility of the source and the clarity of the infor- mation being given. (...) Indeed, unlike the existing models, which appear to be exclusively linear, the model that resulted from this synthesis was potentially more recursive: the decision-making stage might still be revisited on the basis of side-effects ("risks") experienced at the stage of use. This new model can therefore be seen not only to validate, but also to build upon, extend and contextualise existing, relevant published models. The a priori boxes of Contemplation, i.e. perceived need; Determination, i.e. decision-making; and Action, i.e. use and maintenance, have been opened to reveal the complexities of the factors therein, their relationships and moderators. @carroll2011worked*

*(Sobre las diferencias/desviaciones entre los enfoques habituales y el empleado por los autores) This approach differs from other published versions of framework synthesis in which the apriori framework was developed from a range of sources, including familiarisation with and consultation around the published background literature, both theoretical and empirical, and personal experiences \[5,6\]. The approach taken here is of potential value for systematic reviewers as it does not require such extensive literature review, consultations or topic expertise to develop an a priori framework before embarking on the review itself. This may be of particular value when undertaking a synthesis of qualitative evidence within the limited timeframes of a health technology @carroll2011worked*

*(y sigue con la justificación) However, if a framework of related, relevant concepts already exists, then the approach used here permits a far more rapid identification of the a priori framework; it also permits more rapid and structured coding and synthesis of data from the review's included studies than grounded-theory techniques. In this way, where existing theories or models exist, they can be tested against the evidence for the review's own particular criteria and evidence. This approach is therefore potentially more pragmatic than other forms of qualitative data synthesis (...) Furthermore it provided a mechanism for flagging up and explicitly communicating diver- gent findings or themes within the review team. The resultant synthetic product is expressed as an enhanced model recording each key dimension identified; the nature of the concepts under study; and associations between themes and tensions between them \[6\] @carroll2011worked*

### Stage 6: Generation of the final model {.unnumbered}

In the final stage, the author integrated insights from earlier stages with the original research questions and emerging themes. This process involved reviewing, recombining, collapsing, and condensing charts and other data representations to align with the study's focus and major patterns. As such, this stage involved synthesizing key characteristics of the data set and elucidating emergent categories, associations, and patterns.

Researchers explore variations across the dataset, within subgroups, and thematic clusters, aiming to construct a cohesive narrative that elucidates the underlying structure and patterns within the data, thus providing nuanced explanations. Gradually, researchers discern characteristics within the dataset, potentially leading to the development of typologies, questioning theoretical constructs (whether pre-existing or emergent from the data), or mapping interconnections among categories to investigate relationships and potential causal relationships [@gale2013using]. However, the synthesis process entails more than aggregating patterns; it requires careful consideration of the salience and dynamics of issues and the search for a coherent structure amidst the evidence.

Mapping and interpretation may yield diverse outputs, such as describing key concepts, delineating the nature and scope of phenomena, elucidating associations, explaining attitudes, experiences, and behaviors, and developing typologies. Therefore, researchers are tasked with piecing together the overall picture, drawing on the richness of the data to provide meaningful interpretations that address the research objectives effectively. In this pursuit, the researcher's creativity plays a pivotal role when selecting the most appropriate approach to convey the findings effectively. As Ritchie and Spencer [-@ritchie2002qualitative] emphasize, the importance of flexibility and innovation is key to presenting analytical outcomes.

### Literature selection

Criterios para elegir la literatura primaria y complementaria. Criterios de búsqueda en base de datos.

*A systematic search to identify relevant studies was performed by an information specia- list following piloting of appropriate search strategies. The search combined terms describing the agents of interest (NSAIDs, aspirin, vitamins, etc.) with a pub- lished, validated filter for identifying qualitative studies, together with the medical subject heading "qualitative research" \[11\]. The full search strategy is available in the Appendix (...) Study selection To be included in the review, a study had to focus on exploring the attitudes, perceptions and beliefs of adults (any country) surrounding the taking of the agents listed above, through qualitative data from interviews or focus groups, and cross-sectional data from satisfaction sur- veys,i.e.unstructured andstructured, but often textual data describing people's own, personal, subjective experiences, views or attitudes relating to the interven- tion of interest. @carroll2011worked*

*To uncover peer reviewed research on school-based positive education interventions, a systematic literature search was conducted using the four databases of: Scopus®, Google Scholar, PsycINFO®, and Web of Science®. Additionally, the reference lists of review articles that were identified through the above search were cross-checked using the ancestry method outlined in Lyubomirsky et al. (2005), in order to capture the broadest collection of relevant articles possible. To qualify for inclusion, studies had to meet eight key criteria. First, the study had to be peer-reviewed and published in an academic journal and, thus, have withstood the scrutiny of the peer review process. Second, the (...) @waters2019search*

*Seventy-five school-based positive education intervention studies were identified as meeting the criteria above and form the basis of this review. Table One provides definitions of the six SEARCH pathways and lists the sub-categories of interventions that were identified in each pathway for the current review. @waters2019search*

*For consistency across the presentation of the review findings, the same structure has been used when mapping each of the six pathways to the studies identified. First, the specific interventions that can be mapped to each pathway are identified. For example, under the pathway of attention and awareness, the specific interventions identified in the school-based interventions were mindfulness and meditation (...)@waters2019search*

*Finally, and most importantly, the evidence supporting each pathway is considered. This evaluation is structured around the three key research questions listed in the former section and considers how the evidence meets Seligman et al.'s(2009) broad aims of positive education: to improve both wellbeing and academic outcomes.\@waters2019search* *3.2 Pathway One: Strengths*

*Literature searching and analysis* *Our literature searches across medicine, nursing, social welfare and the social sciences covered reports published in academic journals and patient- and carer-group publications, and unpublished reports accessible through professional and patient or public networks. As we accumulated literature, we followed an iterative process similar to framework analysis as applied to primary research data (ver Ritchie). This involved familiarization with the literature; gradually developing a conceptual framework using concepts embedded in the review question, and in the theoretical and empirical literature; applying the framework systematically to the data; and subsequently rearranging the data within the framework in order to construct a chart for each key dimension with distilled summaries from all relevant documents identified. The charts were then used to map the range and nature of involvement and find associations between themes with a view to providing explanations for the findings. We describe below the key concepts used to build our framework, and how these were combined so as to enable us to analyse and draw conclusions from the literature. @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Categorizing the literature* *As well as reports of public involvement, we found discussion papers about differing priorities, conceptual frameworks, community equi- poise, power, democratic practice and advocacy. These papers drew on a wide range of theories, and described episodes of involvement in many different research areas. (...)The health topics covered in the literature included different health conditions (asthma, breastfeeding (...) The papers came from different disciplines (agricul- ture, genetics, environmental studies) and reported different research methodologies (sys- tematic reviews, technology assessment, participatory research). @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Reports of public involvement were first characterized as ÔpurposefulÕ, ÔopportunisticÕ or ÔindirectÕ. (a continuación hay que explicar a qué se refiere cada) @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Framework analysis is designed so that it can be viewed and assessed by people other than the primary analyst. Consequently, framework analysis in a systematic review displays the data in such a way that readers can navigate the charts to find evidence relevant to their circumstances (in this case, for instance, international or national programmes or individual projects), or to the options available to them (e.g. patient organizations responding to consultations or only entering collaborative partnerships or taking the initiative). Applying the framework to these data reveals the theories that have been applied to work constructively with individuals,23,24 or within organizations (...) Thus, readers can draw out for themselves relevant implications for their policy and practice from what is known about public involvement in research agenda setting @oliver2008multidimensional*

*Published descriptions of framework synthesis typically exclude studies of lower quality. However this was not the approach used in this case, representing a further innovative deviation from the published method \[2\]. All studies that satisfied the relevance criteria were included because there is an increasingly strong case for not excluding qualitative data studies from evidence synth- esis based on quality assessment \[1,18,19\].(...) Studies were assessed using key quality criteria derived from relevant critical appraisal checklists for qualitative studies \[20\] and other systematic reviews of people's views \[1,2\]. These elements also appear in recent guidance from the Cochrane Qualitative Research Methods Group \[21\]@carroll2011worked*

#### The pearl-growing technique

It is a method used in qualitative research to identify additional sources of information or relevant studies based on the references, citations, or recommendations found in already identified sources. The name "pearl-growing" metaphorically refers to the process of gradually accumulating valuable "pearls" of information as researchers expand their search based on leads found in the initial set of sources.

Here's how the pearl-growing technique typically works:

Initial search: Researchers begin by conducting an initial literature search using databases, search engines, or other sources to identify relevant sources related to their research topic.

Review of references: Once relevant sources are identified, researchers carefully review the reference lists or bibliographies of these sources. They pay particular attention to the sources cited within the papers, as well as any recommended readings provided by the authors.

Identification of additional sources: Researchers then use the references found in the initial set of sources to identify additional studies, articles, books, or other materials that may contain relevant information or contribute to their understanding of the topic.

Iterative process: The process of reviewing references and identifying additional sources is iterative, meaning that researchers continue to expand their search based on the leads found in each round of searching. This process may involve reviewing the references of newly identified sources and repeating the search until saturation is reached, meaning that no new relevant sources are being found.

Evaluation of relevance: As new sources are identified, researchers evaluate their relevance to the research question or objectives. They consider factors such as the alignment of the content with the research topic, the quality of the source, and its potential contribution to the overall understanding of the topic.

Incorporation into the analysis: Finally, researchers incorporate the findings from the additional sources into their analysis or synthesis of the literature. They integrate these new insights with those obtained from the initial set of sources to develop a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

The pearl-growing technique is valuable for ensuring that researchers identify a diverse range of perspectives, theories, and findings relevant to their research topic. By systematically expanding their search based on the references found in already identified sources, researchers can enhance the depth and breadth of their literature review and increase the likelihood of identifying important insights and contributions to the field.

*The methodology uses the bases of a meta-theory and meta-history, parting from a seminal work in that of Marshall. From there the author draws and follows a timeline with which a progress in the motivations and contributions made by biology in economics and business studies can be traced. - How a seminal work is defined? - How the author decides to entertain around a certain seminal work and the works around it?*

*The meta-analysis is nit exhaustive not complete, The conclusions are extracted once saturation is achieved @barnett2009methods.*

*Paterson et al described meta-synthesis as a process which creates a new interpretation which accounts for the results of all three elements of analysis; however, they do not make it clear exactly how all three components of analysis are brought together to achieve this „new interpretation‟.*

*The review was conducted in three parts. First, we searched for and mapped the existing research literature on the general public's views of walking and cycling. Second, we conducted an in-depth review of a subset of this literature, the scope of which was selected by our Advisory Group, focusing on the views of children, young people and parents. Third, we synthesised the findings relating to these 'views studies' together with the research on interventions carried out by Ogilvie et al. (2004). The overall conclusions of the review are thus based both on international evaluations of specific interventions, and from findings of recent 'qualitative' research conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) examining the views and experiences of children, young people and parents. @brunton2006synthesis*

*Analysis of this research revealed four recurrent themes drawn from the views of children, young people and parents: a culture of car use; fear and dislike of local environments; children as responsible transport users; and parental responsibility and behaviour.\@brunton2006synthesis*

## Benefits and flaws

### Benefits

Putting more time into specifying the model, using a wider range of literature, and gaining the views of a wider range of stakeholders may all be important in improving the legitimacy and validity of any ensuring synthesis @dixon2011using.

*One possible reason for framework analysis' popularity is its potential for predictability and efficiency. When paired with a targeted research question and similarly targeted data, framework analysis can be accomplished quickly (Pope et al., 2000). The explicit steps already built into framework analysis can provide clear structure for and boundaries on the analysis. Framework analysis' straightforward and systematic approach can also allow for easy entry for novice researchers and ease of use in multi- disciplinary and mixed-methods research teams (Gale @goldsmith2021using*

*Qualitative researchers use framework analysis for a variety of additional reasons beyond ease of use. Framework analysis can be successfully used for analyzing large, complex qualitative datasets, such as can occur in policy research across multiple jurisdictions or geographies. Framework analysis can be used to methodically describe a population of interest including the notable variation contained within that population. Researchers can also use framework analysis to push beyond a thematic description of a phenomenon to the development of multi-dimensional typologies or theory development. Regardless of the purpose for which framework analysis is employed, systematic movement through the steps of framework analysis naturally provides an explicit audit trail (Parkinson et al., 2016; Smith & Firth, 2011). The methods and results of framework analysis can also be presented in transparent and accessible ways for a variety of audiences, meeting the dependability and credibility needs of applied researchers and applied research funders (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994).\@goldsmith2021using*

*While framework analysis can be simple and straightforward under the right conditions, framework analysis is not inherently simple, quick or undemanding. Researchers undertaking framework analysis, for instance, must be prepared to work both systematically and dynamically (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). @goldsmith2021using*

*Framework analysis' demand for structure and order pushed the TBA dataset analysis beyond the simple listing of themes, which further benefitted the comparison between stakeholder groups. The charting and mapping demands of framework analysis also meant that each theme was reviewed for each stakeholder group, highlighting variation between stakeholders and helping to surface policy- relevant silences in the data. The results of this framework analysis then helped identify gaps needing bridging before expecting stronger working relationships between TBAs and formal health care workers.\@goldsmith2021using*

*The benefits of framework analysis' order and structure can extend beyond the study completion. As already mentioned in the introduction, the explicitness of the steps of framework analysis provides an easily understandable audit trail and provides non-research audiences access to the inner workings of the analysis. Such transparency can increase the willingness of policy makers, the public, and other knowledge users to engage with and use the research to understand and solve policy problems. Framework analysis' transparency can also be harnessed for future qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research.\@goldsmith2021using*

*I add my voice to others in demonstrating that framework analysis is both a powerful and flexible method for analyzing a variety of types of qualitative data, including secondary data. The examples in this paper and elsewhere show that framework analysis has been effectively used by solo researchers, by teams of qualitative researchers, and by multi-disciplinary and mixed-methods research teams. There are myriad reasons for applied researchers to use framework analysis, including transparency of process and a long and successful track record for better understanding of policy issues and social problems to help policy makers, service deliverers, and other knowledge users with improving program design and decision making. Results from applied research studies using framework analysis have also contributed to better theorizing about phenomena of interest and improvements in the design of future research of any type, whether that future research is qualitative or quantitative, or basic or applied. In sum, framework analysis has value to applied fields and beyond. I hope this paper encourages applied researchers to consider using framework analysis and to employ framework analysis with confidence and rigour. @goldsmith2021using*

*It is not aligned with a particular epistemological viewpoint or theoretical approach and therefore can be adapted for use in inductive or deductive analysis or a combination of the two (e.g. using pre-existing theoretical constructs deductively, then revising the theory with inductive aspects; or using an inductive approach to identify themes in the data, before returning to the literature and using theories deductively to help further explain certain themes).* *- It is easy to identify relevant data extracts to illustrate themes and to check whether there is sufficient evidence for a proposed theme.* *- Finally, there is a clear audit trail from original raw data to final themes, including the illustrative quotes @gale2013using*

*The process enables the researcher to track decisions which ensures links between the original data and findings are maintained and transparent. This adds to the rigour of the research process and enhances the validity of the findings @smith2011qualitative*

**Purpose of Meta-Framework**

-   A meta-framework is understood as an overarching frame for what should inform the analysis and eventually the design of STI practice frameworks, meaning frameworks used by or provided for transportation policy and planning bodies to select and apply indicators for sustainable transportation. The meta-framework is not a general theory, nor a master framework to be adopted directly by agencies, but a **classification** and **evaluation** device. @cornet2015building

-   Comparative analysis based on the meta-framework could identify common features and gaps, and be used as **a basis for testing hypotheses** regarding how indicators influence decisions on option generation, design, operation, maintenance and other aspects of transportation systems. Eventually it should help evolve sustainability measurement in transportation planning from a position as a niche, ad hoc, or add-on activity into something like an "Organizing Principle for Transportation Agencies", as it has recently been formulated (21). @cornet2015building

-   Therefore, rather than a 'recipe' to be applied directly by agencies, the meta-framework is first and foremost a scheme for further empirical analysis of existing frameworks. The next step is to refine and apply the criteria via empirical analysis of how frameworks have been developed and used in real world conditions. Eventually this will allow for building a robust set of criteria based on theory as well as realism @cornet2015building

*Methodologically the authors found this "best fit" approach to framework synthesis, as developed and tested in this review, to be a useful, fairly rapid and reli- able and, above all, pragmatic method of synthesising qualitative data. This "best fit" approach to synthesis was therefore found to work well overall, particularly within the role previously identified as an existing strength, namely for testing existing potentially generalisable theories and models within a specific context. However, such a "best fit" approach would benefit from further testing and refinement.\@carroll2011worked*

*The authors suggest that this "best fit" approach occupies a pragmatic middle ground between grounded theory-type and framework based syntheses and acknowledge the need for further evaluation carroll2011worked*

### Flaws of Framework Method

*The method is however dependent on the identification of an appropriate existing conceptual model.( )...) it required search strategies that aimed to maximise the likelihood of retrieving a model of pragmatic utility to the project; the aim was not the systematic identification of all such models.\@carroll2011worked*

*Some issues were encountered when piloting this "best fit" framework synthesis method. When initially seeking to code the extracted data from the included studies using the themes derived from the relevant model, the two reviewers were not always coding the same data against the same themes. It therefore became apparent that each of the a priori themes had to be clearly defined in order to facilitate the coding process (...) The subsequent provision of clear consensual definitions not only enhanced the reliability of the coding, but also strengthened the rigour of the synthesis. @carroll2011worked*

*It further became apparent that additional analysis was needed to interpret and analyse data which could not be reliably assigned to any of the pre-existing, apriori themes, or, in the case of "personal factors",forwhich the pre-existing theme was inadequate. In this sense the usefulness of a particular framework is not only deter- mined by "conceptual fit" but also by pragmatic concerns of what proportion of the study data can be accommodated within it. Further thematic analysis of data from the included studies was therefore required. @carroll2011worked*

*The resulting agreed new themes were then incorporated with the pre-existing themes into a new conceptual model that captured the data and reflected a possible network of relationships between those data-driven themes. The @carroll2011worked*

*Finally, this review did not exclude studies on the basis of quality, thereby deviating from one element of the published description of framework synthesis \[2\]. The internal validity of a review depends in part on the quality of included studies and the reliability of their findings. Currently there is much debate and little consensus around the feasibility and usefulness of quality assessments of qualitative studies in evidence synthesis \[18\].(...) Some techniques, such as meta-ethnography \[4\], and the previously published form of framework synth- esis, actively exclude studies on the basis of the quality assessment.(...) All twenty included studies were assessed as being of similar, generally satisfactory "quality", so, from this perspective, study quality did not provide a poten- tial explanation for any differences in findings. The issue of the inclusion or exclusion of studies for this type of synthesis, based on their assessed quality, therefore remains unresolved based on this case study. @carroll2011worked*

*It is also the case that an apparently appropriate a priori model may be found only to accommodate a small proportion of the data from a review's included studies. In such a case, secondary thematic analysis would form the principal approach to synthesis, thus reducing the major potential pragmatic benefits of the best-fit approach described in this paper. Reviewers must therefore exercise careful consideration of the potential external validity of existing models based on the behaviour and population of interest @carroll2011worked*

## Other

### Atlas.ti

**Process (according to Atlas.ti):** Thematic framework: Central to framework analysis is the development of a framework identifying key themes, concepts, and relationships in the data. The framework guides the subsequent stages of coding and charting.

Flexibility: While it provides a clear structure, framework analysis is also adaptable. Depending on the objectives of the study, researchers can modify the process to better suit their data and questions.

Iterative process: The process in framework analysis is not linear. As data is collected and data analysis progresses, researchers often revisit earlier stages, refining the framework or revising codes to better capture the nuances in the data.\*

**Benefits of framework analysis** Conducting framework analysis has several advantages:

Rigorous data management: The structured approach means data is managed and analyzed with a high level of rigor, minimizing the potential influence of preconceptions.

Inclusivity: Framework analysis accommodates both a priori issues, driven by the research questions, and emergent issues that arise from the data itself.

Comparability: Given its structured nature, framework analysis allows researchers to compare and contrast data, facilitating the identification of patterns and differences.

Accessibility: By presenting data in a summarized, charted form, findings from framework analysis become more accessible and comprehensible, aiding in reporting and disseminating results.

Relevance for applied research: Given its origins in policy research and its clear focus on addressing specific research questions, framework analysis is particularly relevant for studies aiming to inform policy or practice.

**Implementing** Familiarization with the data Before discussing a more detailed analysis, it's paramount to understand the breadth and depth of the data at hand.

Reading and re-reading: Begin by reading textual data such as transcripts, field notes, and other data sources multiple times. This immersion allows researchers to understand participants' perspectives and grasp the overall context.

Noting preliminary ideas: As researchers familiarize themselves with the data, preliminary themes or ideas may start to emerge. Jotting these down in memos helps in forming an initial understanding and can be instrumental in the subsequent phase of developing a set of themes.

Developing a thematic framework As is the case across nearly all types of qualitative methodology, central to framework analysis is the construction of a robust analytical framework. This structure aids in organizing and interpreting the data.

Identifying key themes: Based on the initial familiarization, it's important to identify themes that occur in the multimedia or textual data. These themes should be relevant to the research question. Researchers can begin assigning codes to specific chunks of data to capture emerging themes.

Categorizing and coding: Each identified theme can further be broken down into sub-themes or brought together under categories. At this stage, researchers can continue coding (or recoding) their data according to these themes or categories.

Refining the framework: As the analysis progresses, the initial themes represented by your coding framework may need adjustments. It's an iterative process, where the framework can be continually refined to better fit the data.

Indexing and charting the data Once the framework is established, the next phase involves systematically applying it to the data.

Indexing: Using the resulting coding framework, you can verify that codes have been systematically assigned to relevant portions of the data. This ensures every relevant piece of data is categorized under the appropriate theme or sub-theme.

Charting: This step involves creating charts or matrices for each theme. Data from different sources (like interviews or focus groups) is summarized under the relevant theme. For example, a table can be created with each theme in a column and each data source in a row, and researchers can then populate the cells with relevant data extracts or notes. These charts provide a visual representation, allowing researchers to easily see patterns or discrepancies in the data.

Mapping and Interpretation: With the data systematically charted, researchers can begin to map the relationships between themes and interpret the broader implications. This step is where the true essence of the research emerges, as researchers link the patterns in the data to the broader objectives of the study.

Framework analysis is an involved process, with intentional decision-making at every step of the way. As a result, implementing structured qualitative methodologies such as framework analysis requires patience, meticulous attention to detail, and a clear understanding of the research objectives. When conducted diligently, it offers a transparent and systematic approach to analyzing qualitative data, ensuring the research not only has depth but also clarity.

Whether comparing data across multiple sources or drilling down into the nuances of individual narratives, framework analysis equips researchers with the tools needed to derive meaningful insights from their qualitative data. As more researchers across disciplines recognize its value, it stands to become an even more integral part of the research landscape.
