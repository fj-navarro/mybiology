# Methodology

The author employed a systematic approach that leveraged existing works in the domain of natural sciences to construct a preliminary evolutionary framework. This framework served as a foundation for streamlining the identification, coding, and synthesis of data from studies in the domain of evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm. By leveraging those relevant concepts, theories, and models present in key evolution-centered works in the field of natural science, the author achieved a more efficient means of establishing an a priori framework. This facilitated the testing of existing theories and models in evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm against our preliminary criteria.

Moreover, this methodological choice served as a pragmatic alternative to other forms of qualitative data synthesis. By flagging and communicating divergent findings or themes along the meta-framework construction process, the author ensured transparency and facilitated discussion around the synthesized findings. The resulting synthetic product is an enhanced framework that captures the key theories and concepts under study, and associations between themes and tensions identified in the literature. This comprehensive approach enhances the rigor and reliability of the methodological process [@carroll2011worked].

The approach employed in this study diverges from conventional methods utilized in framework synthesis. Unlike other published versions, where the a priori framework is typically developed through extensive literature review, consultations, and topic expertise, our approach does not require such exhaustive processes beforehand. Instead, the author started from a corpus of pre-existing literature and a seminal work that contained the key concepts and the relationships between them in the adjacent field of natural sciences. This foundation allowed for a faster and more efficient coding and synthesis process compared to traditional meta-framework construction methods. By circumventing the need for extensive preparatory work, our approach offers a more efficient and streamlined method for conducting framework synthesis, enabling authors to focus more directly on the review process itself.

## Objectives

The present study delineates a comprehensive meta-framework designed to fulfill several pivotal objectives. Foremost among these aims is the systematic description and synthesis of primary and secondary data, incorporating an examination of the fundamental interrelationships inherent within. Concurrently, the meta-framework endeavors to map the evolutionary trajectory of pertinent studies in the domain of business scholarship and the theory of the firm, aligning them methodically within its overarching structure.

The meta-framework aspires to transcend conventional paradigms of data synthesis, aspiring instead to furnish a novel interpretive lens through which to scrutinize the theory of the firm from an evolutionary standpoint. By foregrounding the dynamic interplay between firms and their milieu, this endeavor represents a departure from static conceptualizations, facilitating a nuanced understanding of organizational behavior within an ever-changing economic landscape.

Furthermore, it is incumbent upon the meta-framework to engender a tangible utility for both academic scholars and industry practitioners alike. Hence, the resultant synthesis is envisaged as a flexible tool, amenable to facilitating a deeper comprehension of firm-level decision-making processes and behavioral dynamics. In effect, the meta-framework is envisaged to serve as a practical aid, fostering enhanced insights and efficacious strategies pertinent to scholarly inquiry and managerial practice within the realm of business economics.

## Stages in the Construction of the Meta-Framework

Framework analysis is a robust methodological approach that comprises five stages that facilitate systematic qualitative data analysis. Beginning with data familiarization and culminating in mapping and interpretation, these stages ensure comprehensive exploration and synthesis of research findings. Each stage plays a critical role in elucidating patterns, themes, and associations within the data, ultimately contributing to a nuanced understanding of the research topic. Notably, the framework approach's flexibility enables adaptation to various research contexts, including longitudinal studies, case studies, and projects involving diverse participant groups. By embracing the methodological rigor inherent in framework analysis, researchers can effectively navigate the complexities of qualitative data and advance knowledge in their respective fields.

### Stage 1: Familiarization {.unnumbered}

The initial stage of meta-framework construction, familiarization, aims at providing the researcher with a purposeful understanding of the collected data. Through an immersive engagement with the dataset, researchers embark on purposeful reading and re-reading of the data, allowing them to identify key ideas, patterns, and variations, as well as recurrent themes that underpin the richness of the data that serve as the foundation for subsequent analytical endeavors. This stage is instrumental in establishing a foundational comprehension of the dataset, encompassing an exploration of major themes pertinent to the research questions and their recurrence throughout the data. Data familiarization extends until the researcher attains a comprehensive grasp of the dataset's breadth of variation [@ritchie2002qualitative; @goldsmith2021using].

Specifically during the familiarization stage of our study, the author identified a seminal work from the existing literature that explored the trajectory of the evolutionary concept in the natural sciences through a historical lens [@bowler2003evolution]. This work encapsulated fundamental concepts, theories, and their interrelationships over time, providing a foundational understanding of the evolutionary process within natural scientific thinking. Leveraging insights from Bowler's work, the author conducted a comprehensive review of the dataset, thoroughly examining recurring themes, patterns, and nuances pertinent to the domain of evolution in natural science. This process ultimately led to the formulation of a preliminary framework on the theme of evolutionary natural sciences in the subsequent stage of the methodological process.

### Stage 2: Developing a preliminary thematic framework {.unnumbered}

Framework development is an iterative process that allows for refinement through testing against data subsets, enabling the progression from simple descriptions to conceptual abstractions [@goldsmith2021using; @gale2013using]. The development of themes involves systematic pattern recognition, often employing techniques such as the constant comparative method [@gale2013using]. In practice, researchers utilize computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) to organize data and develop nuanced understandings. The emphasis lies in identifying important themes and conceptual relationships rather than detailing their manifestation in the data, allowing for flexibility in approach based on the researcher's familiarity with the dataset and research objectives [@goldsmith2021using].

Following the immersion in the data provided by Bowler's seminal work during the familiarization stage, the author embarked on the task of developing a preliminary thematic framework focusing on the evolutionary process in the natural sciences. This stage marked the transition from data immersion to abstraction and conceptualization, aiming to identify inherent patterns and concepts within the dataset while aligning with the overarching research goals [@ritchie2002qualitative]. The preliminary thematic framework functioned as a scaffold, enabling the integration of new data gleaned from the evolutionary economics and theory of the firm literature, thereby facilitating ongoing refinement, expansion, or streamlining of the framework.

While the preliminary evolutionary framework did not perfectly align with the study's topic, it provided a "best-fit" and relevant pre-existing themes against which to map and code data extracted from selected studies within evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm domain [@carroll2011worked]. By leveraging Bowler's comprehensive dataset as a foundation, the author adopted an augmentative and deductive approach, capitalizing on pre-existing knowledge within the field of natural sciences rather than commencing the analysis from a blank slate. This methodological choice enabled a nuanced and more agile analysis of the literature reviewed grounded in robust theoretical foundations.

### Stage 3: Literature search and selection {.unnumbered}

The author employed a systematic review approach to conduct a literature search and selection specific to the domain of evolutionary economics and the theory of the firm. This involved formulating a search strategy tailored to the research questions, which required using relevant terms and filters to identify pertinent studies.

The search strategy incorporated specific keywords such as "EVOLUTIONARY" AND ("FIRM" OR "ENTERPRISE" OR "BUSINESS" OR "ECONOMICS"), along with filters restricting the search to only papers written in English and without any date constraints. Multiple databases, including Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science®, were systematically queried to ensure comprehensive coverage.

**For inclusion in the review, studies were required to satisfy three key criteria: first, they needed to focus on exploring evolution from an economics, business, or theory of the firm perspective; second, they had to meet... And third,...**

**Seventy-five studies meeting the established criteria were identified, forming the foundation of the review. Table 1 outlines the definitions of the three SEARCH pathways and enumerates the sub-categories of studies identified within each pathway. Alongside research papers and books on evolutionary economics, various discussion papers delineating differing conceptual frameworks, employing diverse research methodologies, and exhibiting varying degrees of connection to the theory of the firm were also discovered.**

Given the relatively low number of selected studies, a literature pearl-growing technique was additionally employed.The pearl-growing technique is a qualitative research method employed to discover supplementary sources of information or relevant studies by leveraging references, citations, or recommendations found within already identified sources. The process began after the initial literature search using databases to pinpoint relevant materials. The author then carefully reviewed the reference lists or bibliographies of these sources, paying close attention to cited sources and recommended readings. Subsequently, the identified references were utilized to unearth additional studies, articles, or books that may enrich the understanding of the topic. The iterative process involved expanding the search based on newly discovered leads until saturation was reached. The author critically evaluated the relevance of these new sources, considering their alignment with the research question and potential contribution. Finally, findings from these additional sources were integrated into the synthesis of the literature, enhancing understanding. This technique ensured the identification of diverse perspectives, theories, and findings, enriching the literature review and increasing the likelihood of uncovering significant insights [@petticrew2008systematic; @barnett2009methods].

### Stage 4: Indexing {.unnumbered}

Once the preliminary thematic framework was established and studies were selected, the author moved on to the indexing stage, a systematic process akin to creating an index for a book. This involved the application of the established framework to the studies data. In essence, the author linked the data from studies with the components of the framework by assigning relevant thematic references to passages within the textual data [@ritchie2002qualitative].

During the indexing process, the author made subjective judgments regarding the meaning and significance of each passage, considering both its individual context and its broader relevance to the research. The data was coded and annotated using the Atlas.ti software, rendering the indexing process transparent and facilitating collaboration and validation within the research community. Moreover, this stage offered an opportunity for framework refinement, as the author evaluated the compatibility of the preliminary framework with the data from the selected studies. Necessary adjustments to component definitions and boundaries were made through iterative revision until all data were indexed on the final framework. Ultimately, indexing ensured the alignment between the framework and the data from the studies, thereby facilitating subsequent analysis and interpretation [@goldsmith2021using]

Although there were some helpful overlaps that facilitated the rapid and reliable coding of a significant portion of data from the selected studies, the preliminary framework proved inadequate in terms of depth or complexity to fully account for all the data in the included studies.

**(... lo que sigue es el ejemplo de explicación) All of these characteristics were found in the included studies to affect perceived need and decision- making. It was felt that the pre-existing theme of "personal factors" alone was insufficient to illustrate the complexity of factors at play. The role of age, gender and the physical properties of agents were new factors identified by the synthesis affecting the a priori theme of use, which were absent from the original conceptual model. @carroll2011worked**

**(see Figure X) Very little study data were coded against the themes of "Spending capacity" (or "Costs")and "Access: obtaining the agent",which may reflect differences in the cultural context of the preliminary conceptual model (a low-income country in South America) compared with the studies included in the review (principally UK, Europe and North America). However, relatively more substantial amounts of data were coded against the remaining themes. @carroll2011worked**

### Stage 5: Charting {.unnumbered}

Having indexed the textual data according to the thematic framework, transition to the charting phase involved consolidating individual insights into a cohesive portrayal of the data, thereby providing a holistic view of the research findings. As charting was built upon earlier decisions made in the indexing step, it allowed for revisiting and enhancing the selection and organization of units of analysis and framework components. In practice, this process involved the creation of one or more matrix-based charts aimed at summarizing the data, where rows and columns delineated units of analysis and framework components. The author established the structure of the chart, populated its cells with summarized data, and determined the appropriate level of abstraction.

By lifting data from its original context and rearranging it according to relevant themes, a deeper insight into **the range of attitudes and experiences** encapsulated within the data was gained that informed the overarching research objectives[@ritchie2002qualitative]. Various tools, including pen and paper, word processing programs, spreadsheets, and computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS), were utilized to create charts.

### Stage 6: Generation of the final model {.unnumbered}

In the final stage of the synthesis process, the author integrated insights gleaned from preceding stages with the original research questions and emerging themes. This entailed a comprehensive review, recombination, consolidation, and condensation of charts to harmonize with the study's focal points and predominant patterns. In this endeavor, the author's creativity played an instrumental role in selecting the most suitable approach to effectively convey findings [@gale2013using; @ritchie2002qualitative].
