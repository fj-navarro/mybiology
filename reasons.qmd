Alchian  determines that there is a double reason to ask for a new economic analysis. These are an incomplete information in the functioning of the economic system and a uncertain foresight. The latter recognizes the role of prediction that every economic analysis must play if it's to be good.

The recourse to this perspective allow him to introduce the idea of "adoptive mechanism" as a means to interpret the economic system as one "(...)which chooses among exploratory actions generated by the adaptive pursuit of "success" or "profits"."
