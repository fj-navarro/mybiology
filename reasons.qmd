# Reasons

@alchian1950uncertainty submits that there is a double reason to ask for a new economic analysis. These are an incomplete information in the functioning of the economic system and uncertain foresight. The latter recognizes the role of prediction that every economic analysis must play if it's to be good.

This vision proposed by Alchian in 1954 moves away from the typical axiom of "profit maximization" and the prediction of the individual behavior of the firm as primary means for understanding the behavior of the firm. Instead, Alchian provides a solution by suggesting the adoption of biological evolution and natural selection as thinking paradigms. The introduction of this new approach allows Alchian to treat an economic system as an adaptive "mechanism" able to choose among those "(...) exploratory actions generated by the adaptive pursuit of"success" or "profits"." 

A valuable benefit of this new perspective is that economic analysts can, according to Alchian, now confront problems that were previously considered aberrant or that required an ad-hoc analytical apparatus.Ultimately, it is an approach that widens the capabilities of economic analysis and prevents the analyst from having to introduce unrealistic assumptions to reach any coherent result.

However, Alchian's innovative approach remains half-finished because he assumes that he will continue using the same conceptual apparatus of his analytical predecessors. That is to say, the same concepts used in the type of analysis based on profit maximization seem to continue serving under its new perspective.
