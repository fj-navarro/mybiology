# Reasons

Alchian  determines that there is a double reason to ask for a new economic analysis. These are an incomplete information in the functioning of the economic system and uncertain foresight. The latter recognizes the role of prediction that every economic analysis must play if it's to be good.

The vision proposed by Alchian in 1954 moves away from the typical axiom of "profit maximization" and the prediction of the individual behavior of the firm as primary means for understanding the behavior of the firm. Instead, Alchian provides a solution by suggesting the adoption of biological evolution and natural selection as thinking paradigms. The recourse to this perspective allows Alchian to introduce the idea of "adoptive mechanism" as a means to interpret the economic system as one "(...) which chooses among exploratory actions generated by the adaptive pursuit of "success" or "profits"."

In reality, Alchian's innovative approach remains half-finished because he himself in his work (...) assumes that he will continue using the same conceptual apparatus of his analytical predecessors. That is to say, the same concepts used in the type of analysis based on profit maximization seem to continue serving under its new perspective.
